Bread, then I get my head (Uh)
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure (Closure, closure)
Losing my composure
Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure (My closure)
Losing my composure (My composure)
Enviyon on the mix

Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead, bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'til the end, in it 'til it's over
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead, bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'til the end, in it 'til it's over

Cash I need all the bread, need it all
Fourth-quarter range ball, 'til I fall
Spend 50k, floss in the mall
Countin' all this money, I'ma spend it all
Molly in her drank got her off the wall
Now she takin' Xans with some Adderall
Baby, I'm the plug like I'm in the wall
I won't tell a soul baby, not at all
Jumpin' in the party and we finna rock out
He was talkin' shit, I told that boy to pipe down
He don't know my brodie got it on him right now
Say one more word, click-clack, lights out

One more word
He don't know my brodie got it on him right now
Say one more word
Say one more word, click-clack, lights out

Get my bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead, bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'til the end, in it 'til it's over
Bread, then I get my head, then I get my closure
Dead, bullets in his head, shouldn't have been a poser
Yeah, I don't want no friends, I'ma be a loner
Yeah, in it 'til the end, in it 'til it's over

Yeah, in it to the end, in it to the end
Have no friends, pull up in the Benz, fuckin' on yo' friends
On yo' friend, that's my fuckin' main, she gon' do what I say
Whole time, I'm runnin' game, run it like a relay
Whole time, I'm runnin' game, run it like a relay
Fuck on yo' fuckin' main, scratch it like a DJ
In my lane, in my fuckin' lane, ninety on the freeway
That's yo' main? She just gave me brain, we just had a three-way
We just had a three-way
Money comin' three ways
Every day I get paid
Every day I get laid
And that's my closure
Dead, bullets in his head
Shouldn't have been a poser (He's a poser, poser)
I'm in it 'til it's over
I'm in it 'til it's over (It's over, it's over)
Then I get my closure
Shouldn't have been a poser
I'ma be a loner
In it 'til it's over
Then I get my closure
Shouldn't have been a poser17Embed
