Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talk

Ay, ay, these rappers rockin' fake jewels, mines is all real
Diamonds on my Roley way before my record deal
I'm fresh outta jail, worth about a mill
And my money long like a football field
Little Dickies pockets full of hundred dollar bills
Finna pull it out, and show you how I feel
First we pop bottles and the champagne spills
They say, "Nipsey, what's that smell?" and I say "That's that kill"
Shank costs a kilo, girls look Creole
Smokin' on the good, sippin' on the Cliquot
Take 'em to the hood, Nip be like a freak, though
She gon' put her face to the wood like a peephole
Now, when I talk to ya, I talk money like my teeth gold
Pockets full of big faces, call 'em NipC-notes
Cars never repoed, 'cause we don't ever lease those
I look like money, bitch, so what I got to speak for, huh?

Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talk

Listen, look, look, now let me talk to ya, let's talk money
My wrist so rocky, my chain so chunky
Now that I'm on TV, they say I'm actin' funny
What, them niggas wanna hate me 'cause their bitches wanna fuck me?
Pitchin' every penny, I'm flippin' every dollar
So if you got a man, girlfriend, you should dash him
We heavy in the club, throwin' money, poppin' bottles
Your man ain't in the club, so when we leave you should follow
We shuttin' down the street, burnin' rubber, hoppin' hollows
Green on top of cheese, on top of chips like nachos
Slauson Ave get cash, Neighborhood got dough
And I got O's in the street like a pothole

Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talk to you, said let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's talk money
Let me, let me talk to you, let's, let's talk money, money
I talk back, I talk
Let me, let me, let me talkEmbed
