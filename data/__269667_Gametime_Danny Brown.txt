Before a blunt I blow a newport like an appetiser
Grab a mic' and get vexed, blow your amplifiers
Can't find me in the hood without a kush stick
That's like Cornel West eating out a white bitch
Rap's Robin trying to give to the poor
But these batty man Robin Givens
Never slipping on these bitches I ain't tripping
(?) like a wack transmission
I saw the signs like the Ace of Base in it
Opened my eyes like I was surprised
I rep the D' with a whole lot of pride
And do that until the day that I die
Fashion thatâ€™s influenced by the skaters
SB's, Levi's, capital E's
White girls on me, and im'a take advantage

Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time
Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time

It's like that, you know it's like that
Number 10 white Jordans with the grey and black
When I attack they need more than a ice pack
If you come back and fuck around and have an eye patch
This rap shit is more than my hobby
But iller than a convict who killed for one
Blowing blunts with my nigga and we still ain't done
Smack any motherfucker who says hustling's fun
Trying to chill from going nuts
Planning to get piff while listening to Donuts
(?) hold up, bitch nigga run it
Kick it in your stomach like you've got a baby in it
Why you so timid? I'm ready for action
Bumping Electric Relaxation what's happening?
What's with all the hating?
You might also like
Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time
Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game timeEmbed
