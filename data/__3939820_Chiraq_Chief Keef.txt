Can't even be in my own hometown
They said that I wouldn't make it out (I made it to Beverly)
My aunty miss her baby
My grandma, that's who raised me
My mommy is my queen, that's an understatement
That's probation, move vacation
Letâ€™s toast to more life and more paper
She don't love you, then replace her, like, "Peace, see you later"

Chiraq, Chiraq
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie
Don't die, don't die, I will come back to you

They trying boobie trap you, go around
Ten toes, I'ma stand my ground
If I lean baby hold it down
Used to steal my granny car to ride around (Ride around, Ride around)
Everybody be like, "When you coming home?"
Tryna get my life straight, I need a comb, ayy
I've been busy out here on my own, ayy
Tryna figure out a way to live on
We will let you go
You might also like
Chiraq, Chiraq
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie
Don't lie, don't die, I will come back to you

Light gettin' at me like an Oakland Raider
But I'm a player, lady persuader
You a alligator, I'm a tiger
Can't see the vision, hand on the bible
I'm a disciple, so I'm forever ridin', yeah
If you against me, you're my rival, yeah
It's people waitin' on my arrival
If you miss a jet, it's gon' fly right by you
My daughter told me, "Daddy, I admire you," ayy

Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Love will come back
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Love will come back
Love will come back
Love will come back
Love will come back to you
Chiraq, Chiraq (Chiraq, Chiraq)
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie (Don't die, don't die)
Don't lie, don't die, I will come back to you

When you come home
God will love when you come to life
She don't love you, then replace her, like, "Peace, see you later"
