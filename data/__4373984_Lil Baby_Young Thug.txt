89 ContributorsLil Baby Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Slatt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I'm surfin')
Woah, woah, woah
I'll totally come and shoot your shit up, know what I'm sayin'?
No cap, woah
Young SEX

Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes (Skrrt)
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby (Top the Forbes)
I don't like no long nails on my lady (Of course)
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest (Toes)
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it (She made it)
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix (Young SEX)

Diamonds on me wetter than a tub
Shoppin' every day 'cause we used to be fucked up
Keep a yellow Cinderella on the tuck
YYB's on, ain't no way I'm givin' up
Different color diamonds on me, bitch, I'm dead wrong
And my bitch in Saudi Arabia, but her redbone (She red)
I got money, niggas doubted, now I'm mad on (Mad on)
Ayy, I got Rollie-Pollies, I'm on two tone (Yeah, yeah)
These tenderoni can't get off me, I see (I see)
My slime brothers Pluto, Savage, and YB (Baby)
Quavo (XO), Takeoff (Scooter), Offset (Roddy), Uzi (RJ)
Lil Durk (Moses), Meek Mill (Nipsey), Drizzy (Travis)
More names (Juice WRLD), plenty (PnB, Young SEX)

Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes (Skrrt)
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby (Top the Forbes)
I don't like no long nails on my lady (Of course)
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest (Toes)
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it (She made it)
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix (Young SEX)

I keep exotic drinks and juices by the crates (Young SEX)
She put my cum in her cup like it was shake
I'll never fuck this bitch again, it was a mistake
I'm Teletubby, diamonds green, blue, white, and grape
I can afford these black diamonds like a spade (Oh)
I maneuver through the city with a maid
I got riches and I guard 'em like the Navy
Pin it up and let me drink it like you're naked (Let's go)
It don't matter the ho call like mine baby (It don't matter)
Got a lil' money to leave your head on the pavement
Flawless carats got these niggas stand in they places
AR'd up before I come and issue statements (Young SEX)

Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes (Skrrt)
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby (Top the Forbes)
I don't like no long nails on my lady (Of course)
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest (Toes)
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it (She made it)
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix
Drippin', drippin' gold (Drip), wipe a nigga nose (Wipe a nigga nose)
This year I'm goin' back thirty-two goals (On you hoes)
This year I seen thirty-two mil' (Yeah)
Last year I popped thirty-five thousand pills (No cap)
Bigger X pill like a ferris wheel (Woo)
I go Juntao, blond hair, yeah
Long living like a motherfuckin' wrestler
If I ask, I know she'll let me live like I'm a bachelor
Mercedes
Baby
My mama hate it
Reveal I'm shady
Ladies
Baby
