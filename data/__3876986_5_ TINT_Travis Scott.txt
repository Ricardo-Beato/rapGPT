Who's that creeping through my window?
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4
Took her to the endzone from the Enzo
Know I love to smoke, you love the liq' more
Wanna hit the Jack, then what you call for?
All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for, mm

Who that creepin'? Know the tint is dark (Five percent)
All that fall-in-love shit, gotta Kevin Hart (Yeah, yeah)
All that speed and fly shit, we might teleport, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All that cop harass shit, I might clip a sarge', yeah (12)
Keep bouncin' that ass, you just might get award, yeah
If she bad, she get a pass into the tour (Passes, yeah)
I pick through the family, grab the bad sister like Janet
Opps outside, don't panic, gotta switch, gotta change up transit
Still jump around, move antsy, and I still don't like shit fancy
Up late feelin' real chancy, they outside really tryna end me, yeah

Who's that creeping through my window? (My window)
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4 (M4)

Wanna hit the Jack, then what you call for? (Yah-ah)
All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for (Yah)

Fuck, don't kiss, fuck, she fuck, don't kiss (Mwah)
Look like friends, but she say they twins (Twins)
Jump right in, there's legroom in this Benz (Legroom in this Benz)
Ten miles to the crib, you know that's deep (Deep, yeah)
I think it's someone out there watching me, yeah
