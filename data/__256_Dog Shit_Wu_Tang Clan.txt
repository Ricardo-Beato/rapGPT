All you bitches put your naps together
And all you niggas put your sticks together

Bitch hooooo
(Yeah haw heh)
Day hayyyy
(Eh hey ay hey)
De haaaaa
(Ewww hawr harr)
Haa-aa-aa-aa-aaa
(Eh haw he huu)

She blew in like calm breeze
Tall brown skin her, weave like palm trees
I went coconuts, dip my Dunkin' between your Donut
Don't want it if it ain't no slut, bitch
Fathership touch ground like fly on soup
Don't invite me I tear the fuck down
White boys cut my toupee
Seventh day rester, or screenplay
I slump MC slay, it ain't nothin' to bust ass
Bullet him, get him fast
Bitch I don't break out, blast to the next rash
The dog piss on MCs like trees
Got mils but still grill that old good welfare cheese
You might also like
Hooooooo
Yeah haaaay
(Dedicated to all you bitch ass niggas)
De haaaaa
(And you bitch ass niggarettes)
Bitch hooooo
(Motherfuckers!)

Let that bitch know

Shame on a nuh, who tried to step tuh
The Ol' Dirty Bas, put my foot up your uhh
Bitch, you walk around with your bra too tight
It's alright, you still gon' get fucked tonight
Hoooooo (Method Man: stankin' ass hoes)
You're the type of bitch don't appreciate shit
Never had shit, so you won't be shit
That pussy there, couldn't satisfy a hair
On my body, treat me like a lolli and slob me down
Doo Doo Brown!
Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones
In the backyard of someone else's house
Ol' Dirt Dog, but I'm not dogged out
Here comes Rover, sniffin' at your ass
But pardon me bitch, as I shit on your grass
That means ho, you been shitted on
I'm not the first dog that's shitted on your lawn
Hoooooo yeah heeeey e haaaaa
Hoooooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Hoooooo yeah heeeey (Wayeah hey hey)
This is dedicated to all y'all bitches (eeeeeeeeeeeee)
De haaaaaaah
Hoooooo yeah heeeey ne haaaaa
Aaaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaa

Fuck y'all

Fuck is y'all niggas, Soul II Soul?
Y'all look like some nasty backup dancers for En Vogue
Lil' nasty R&B niggas
Yo, you look like, you look like you was break dancin' in Allure' video, spinnin' on his lips

What's up wit' bookworm? What's up wit' bookworm?

Fisher Price My First Timberlands

You gotta get some Chukkas, fucka
Nigga got on a Lamont Sanford dress shirt
"Whaddaya want, ya big dummy?"
((Same guy: “Yeah, that’s me nigga!”))
As for me, nigga?
((Yeah that’s you, you DJ…))

And as for you, you DJ Kat Show shirt wearin' ass nigga
Your shirt look like a dish rag
