Yeah
Check this

Two cups nigga, got the red in me (Red in me)
The Ku Klux Klan and the streets with me (Streets with me)
Somethin' real exotic love to sleep with me (Sleep with me)
Somethin' real exotic love to sleep with me
The Molly crumbs got me like a zombie
Her waist line small and that booty look dummy
She done drunk some alcohol, now she 'bout to go dummy
You can check my catalog, I'ma keep some money coming
I done kept the water all night, fuck it keep it running
Gotta call a no fly treaty, 'cause of my necklace

Get a lot of money, put your main bitch on your sideline
Hey, main bitch on the sideline
Get a lot of money, put your main bitch on your sideline
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout (Uh)
I just get them bands and the light become my shadow
(Cut it up)
I just get them Xans and the light become my shadows
I just fucked a fan and she asked me for a shoutout
Nigga talking crazy tryna get the club shot up
I just had some Coke inside the freezer, tryna come up (Tryna)
Everything seems different when you spark a blunt up (Spark)
You in gang territory, dare you tryna run up (Tryna run up)
Dare you try to run up, boy, I dare you try to run up (Dare you try to run up)
I-I dare you try and run up (Try and run up)

I just ran my bands up on a weekday (Weekday)
Gotta keep that hammer on the seat baby (Seat, baby)
I gotta switch my grammar every week baby (Week, baby)
'Til I see a billion dollars, ain't complete baby (Complete, baby)
See a trillion dollars, ain't complete baby (Ain't complete baby)
(See a trillion dollars, ain't complete baby) (Ain't complete baby)
Dare you try to run up, boy, I dare you try and run up (Try and run up)
I-I dare you try and run up (Try and run up)

Christian L's on me, this is not a fairy tale (Fairy tale)
A couple bales on me, I just got it out the mail (Out the mail)
Dom Perignon, let the champagne spill (Champagne spill)
We just get the funds then hit you with the steel (With the steel)
Upper echelon, we'll never miss a meal
You gotta use Waze just to get through the crib
Shawty fell in love with the Codeine and pills
Shawty whip around the city in a half a mil'

Hey, main bitch on the sideline
Get a lotta money, put your main bitch on your sideline
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout (Uh)
I just get them bands, get them Xans, do a shoutout

I just get them Xans and the light become my shadows
I just fucked a fan and she asked me for a shoutout

Off-White leather, gotta pop collars (Pop collars)
Shawty bust it open, want top dollar (Top dollar)
Caught her down bad, bought her Margiela (Margiela)
I did the whole dash, et cetera, et cetera (Et cetera)

Hey, main bitch on the sideline
Get a lotta money put your main bitch on the sideline
