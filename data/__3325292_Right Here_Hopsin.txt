38 ContributorsRight Here Lyrics
A critic has never been able to stop me
Somebody that doesn't like me
They may try to discredit me or even say things that are not true
They've never been able to keep me from rising higher
They can't stop your destiny!
See, an eagle can fly at heights that a crow cannot reach
The crows cannot go where you go

If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, "Here, nigga!"
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga
Yeah, listen up, yeah

Back in 1999 when I picked up a pen
I swear I used to wish for this (Yeah)
And I was so frightened doubting all of my music
I never thought you'd be into it (Yeah)
Now I feel unstoppable like I'm Bradley Cooper
Up in that one movie Limitless (Yeah)
And I done been around the planet a hundred times
Nigga, I'm truly infamous (Yeah)
All the grindin' I put into this
All my fans are feelin' intimate
This shit isn't a coincidence
Treated this game like a glory hole
All I did was stick my dick in it (Yeah)
I do not believe in discipline
Niggas think I be magicianin'
I never needed nobody's opinion and
Cosignin' on whatever my decision is
Rap is all I had during the rough conditions
I bought The Chronic, the deluxe edition
I heard Eminem on "What's The Difference"
I was like, "Oh snap, what the fuck is this shit?!"
My homie Justin played Crooked I
When he had made a remix to the song "Ignition"
I kid you not, it blew my mind, I do not lie
Since then I've been on a mission
To be down with rap until my mind corrodes
I'm dedicated with my life and soul
When I be givin' my all 'til I die and I lie below
Please bury me with the microphone
I ride alone through the night as I flow my pain
Now the whole world know my name
A whole lot changed, I'm givin' everybody mo' octane
And you can see it from the dough I gain, so listen
You might also like
If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, "Here, nigga!"
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga

The game is a painful journey
Thank God I never came in early
Had I blown up in 19 or 20?
But damn Hollywood would've raped and jerked me
Fame woulda went to my brain and hurt me
I had no idea that it may submerge me
One minute you're on top, the next minute you might flop
Man, every single day I'm learning
I use my ill mind to boost me, still ridin' smoothly
Feels like a movie, real lies, I'm truly
Blessed the ways you ain't yesterday, it's too late yesterday
You straight kill time profusely
Go hard, there ain't no excuse
I get a shot then I won't get loose
But I won't let you
Tryin' to take advantage of my hard earned skills, nigga, no can do
Bitches, I am a boss now
The pushovers been tossed out
I deliver the Raw style
I moved outta my mom's house
Anybody who never believed has been crossed out
I got this shit on lock-down
You rappers been knowin' you never get Hop's crown
Even though I come off as a goofy nigga
I assure you I'm what you should not clown
I'm too hard to digest
You might get your eyes wet, 818's what I rep
'Til the day I die yes, H-O-P is timeless
Why the fuck should I stress?
I have accomplished the mission that most'd be proud of
I'm lookin' down on my doubters
I'm laughin' like, "Hahaha! Nigga, now what?"
If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, "Here, nigga!"
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga

Nigga, I'll be right here
Posted on the 818 corner right here
I'm the fuckin' man in this town right here
And I'ma probably die in this city right here
Y'all can find me right here
In Panorama city, aw yeah!
I hear niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga
Let the thing out!
