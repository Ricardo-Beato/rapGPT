Are you asking me? Well, I can't do it! I don't know how to make it sound sexy
Yeah, we gon' slow this down for y'all one time, you know what I mean?
Show you a little bit of versatility on my end
Let's show you how we do it
Listen to this, niggas

Uh, yeah, uh yeah
I don't give a damn if I'm hated, I'll leave you dilapidated
I want that cheese in bulk, fuck a slice, I'ma grated
I give more than you, homie I'm John Q
I'm a youngin' that give it his heart a donor, but you
Ain't got a clue, I call you Silver Stone
Bring punches like I'm Stalone 'cause I'm rockin' 'em
On the rise fast like I'm stockin' 'em
Everybody hear Logic then everybody jockin' 'em
I bring soul like Nike, I love life like Mikey
Nobody like me step on the stage, everybody like me
Drop at least a track a day
Homie, I'm tryna fill a 30 gig
This is nothin' but dedication, yeah, you gotta dig
Keep it blunt like when I spit game
Baby girl, I'm yo' next man, soon to be yo' ex man
'Cause I'm so beast, I'm an animal
Fuck the pussy, but never eat you, I ain't no cannibal
You might also like
Yeah
This what I'm talkin' about
Aight, I'ma get lit up on y'all one time

When the honey's walk by, you know they always slippin'
'Cause I leave 'em drippin'
Holla at yo' boy, I'm down to dippin'
Yeah, I'm from the East Coast, but this flow is grain grippin'
My qualifications exceed great like Britain
I don't sell 'caine 'cause these tracks what I'm flippin'
I'm lookin' for that money you can store up in yo' mattress
So if you wanna shine, you can shine and they can't tax us
Rubbers for my bitches, but the wifey get the plastic
I spit fire like that boy that be so damn fantastic
Keep the flow suspenseful and the punchlines stay drastic
I'ma drop tracks 'til they drop me in the casket
Step around my way, motherfuckers, and get blasted
Yeah, you bitin' like the Dawn of the Dead
And I'ma be the character to put one in yo' head
You lookin' for the brains and you also found the brawn
They should call me James 'cause I'm ballin' like Lebron

Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze1Embed
