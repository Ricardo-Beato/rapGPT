26 ContributorsNo Tears Lyrics
A little gun case, you was younger then
Another violent crime around album number ten, uh
Since a baby, baby, baby
Baby, ghetto baby, you a ghetto, ghetto baby
You a ghetto baby, in QB crazy
You a ghetto baby, you had the records playin'
You's a ghetto baby, fallin' while you skatin'
Sneakers hangin', just a life of a ghetto baby (Shh)
Dear older me
You grown to be the one to coach the team, uh
You still be on your fly shit
Part spiritually psychic, you walk through the haze like Isaac
And maybe this gen will see what you and Hit done
If they don't call it how it is, that's a big dub, uh
That big age you rap, you did your big one
My favorite era from you gotta be this one

Got through the scars, every one, uh
Cops drew down on you with guns, uh
Close friends, you lost some
No tears on your face, none
You missed time seein' your son
It's hard to find genuine love, uh
Family members in them cuffs
No tears on your face, none
Everything is just what you made it out to be
The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops
Held it down alone, mom's on heavenly watch
The tears on my face just stop
You might also like
Uh, dear older me
You became everything you chose to be, huh
Took the wheel and you drove the speed
Out on the road, it took you higher than coca leaves, huh
You at the age you say what it is
You call every girl in your phone like, "Come to the crib"
Ain't gotta hide nothin', what you gotta lie for?
One come through the front, one leavin' out the side door
Potential â€” but what's potential if all are missin' the mental?
And what you been through could mess up now what you into
Got the essentials to murder an instrumental
Made it to Gen Z, deservin' what they extend to you
Talkin' to the younger you
Every stage problems'll still run to you
That big age you rap, you did your big one
My favorite era from you, I can't even pick one

Got through the scars, every one, uh
Cops drew down on you with guns, uh
Close friends, you lost some
No tears on your face, none
You missed time seein' your son
It's hard to find genuine love, uh
Family members in them cuffs
No tears on your face, none
Everything is just what you made it out to be
The world of entertainment got some lessons from your pops
Held it down alone, mom's on heavenly watch
The tears on my face just stop
Talkin' to my younger self
They say in the big fifties
That's when you get rich, rich, rich, rich
In every aspect
You got nothin' to worry about, no tearsEmbed
