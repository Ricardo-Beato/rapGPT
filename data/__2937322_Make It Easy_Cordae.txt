9 ContributorsMake It Easy Lyrics
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted (Yeah)
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted (God damn, God damn)
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted (Oh, man), all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted

Ayy, this for the ones never heard of me
I kill a track and I murder beats
Gotta fix up the game, that's the surgery
On the pack I be geeking like Urkle be
Got that gas, boy, I'm smoking on purple tree
Nigga, I spit that fire, the third degree
All these rapper be liars, they purpin' B
I stay humble and kill it, that's word to Reek
Ayy, I spit that raw shit, you should be cautious
Flow is sick, leave it you nauseous, ayy
I do this often, you niggas soften, lyrics put 'em in coffin, ayy
Hit them like I'm Kenny Lofton
Run the game, niggas crawling
My bank be calling me artist (Why?)
'Cause all I'm doing is withdrawing (Damn)
Hit the plug, lemme hold a pound
He just front me 'cause he know the sound
Brothers good, no one broke around
If a nigga crazy then it's going down
Fuck the violence, this the last time
I don't fuck with black on black crime
I be feeling bad, bros blast nines
So my karma coming, this a bad sign
You might also like
I switch the style and I make it easy
I change my friends because they was greedy
I switch the style and I make it easy
I change my friends because they was...

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
This is all I ever wanted

Codeine crazy got me lazy
Bitches that wouldn't fade me want my baby
Couple years I'll be pushin' that Mercedes
Free lil bro, used fuck with 'em daily
Now I be blowing dope in the club
I used to shovel snow for the dub
Y'all still go to hoes for a hug
I just notice bros showing love, and that's...

You feel me, yeah?
There's always go be something new when a person decides to be themselves, they offer something no-one else can be
Yeah, 'cause once you be you, who can be you but you?
That's what's wrong right now, everybody tryna rap the same style with the - I don't know who created it. If it was Future or Migos, but all them niggas sound the same
(Snoop impersonating Migos)
I said a nigga had me in the studio one night tryna do that shit. I'm like "Man, cut this shit off. What the fuck am I doing here, nigga. I don't rap like that."1Embed
