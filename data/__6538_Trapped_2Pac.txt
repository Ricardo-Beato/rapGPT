You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine-millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never taught peace in the Black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily headed for the big pen'
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I've done a lot of growin' up
Gettin' drunk, throwin' up, cuffed up, then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out to money and fame
I changed my name, played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harasses me, I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see a skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi

They got me trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
They got me trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
Trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
Trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
You might also like
They got me trapped, can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harasskin' me, searching me, then askin' my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall, didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up, throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me, but they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society
Why did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality
Worked me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack, Jack

They got me trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
You know they got me trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
Trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
They got me trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
Now I'm trapped and walkin' for my getaway
All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone's tapping in
Did it before, ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight, the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, "Damn, homie's dissin' you"
Fired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway
Copper say, "Freeze, or you'll be dead today"
Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell

They got me trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
They got me trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
Trapped
Uh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down
You know they got me trapped
Nah, they can't keep the Black man down
Trapped
Yo, y'all seen 2Pac, man? Y'all seen 2Pac, man?
There he go! Ayy 'Pac, ayy, rollers out here, Pac, we gon' bail
Let's go, man...23Embed
