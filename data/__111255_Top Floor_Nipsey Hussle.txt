8 ContributorsTop Floor Lyrics
Yeah, now one time for this fast money
And all these out of state promoters spending cash on me
If fly crippin' was the country, im the flag
Niggas still talking bad but they got they whole swag from me
And I wish a nigga would try and pass on me
AR-15 in a damier bag homie
Im getting racks, I ain't tryna make a rap homie
I fuck with who I fuck with and that's that homie (YEAH!)
100 thousand on my chain and piece
Bitches love to see you shine and I aim to
Please
This world turned a nigga violent but I came in peace
And keep it real until I kill this game, I just ain't complete
She ain't gone make it to the suite if she ain't a freak
Get crackin' in the backseat so she ain't for me
She tried to hit me that wait and see
Told her hope out and get a blunt then I got in the breeze
That type of shit that make me laugh brody
And I ain't met a bitch yet that can swag on me
Mascara tracks but she asked for em
Now I just home she got some cab money

Now am I out here on my grind? that's fasho
Mind on my money, seven days twenty-fo
Dont fuck with dumb niggas, I dont fuck with bum hoes
It ain't nothing to be done out here that I ain't done before
Teach you niggas how to ball, show you what to do with dough
Get everything you want then go back and get some mo
Can you relate? just let me know
If you ain't afraid of heights, meet me on the top floor here I go
You might also like
Look
Now two times for these pink slips
And all these bossy ass deals that we inked in
And ain't no playing with me, I got a 80/20
That mean my shit sell any they gon pay me plenty
It's strictly business in this game, still they faking friendly
Don't let em take advantage of you and it make em envy
Got it so a rap nigga never make a millie
With Nipsey though a middle man'll never make a penny (YOP!)
I'm going hard like I'm 'posed to
And I ain't hanging out with money, that's what hoes do
We poppin' Clicquot at the condo with the cold view
From hanging out the window poppin' pistols out the old school
And I ain't blessing near nigga, kill ya own food
Sacrfice your own years, pay ya own dues
Sell ya own pounds, buy ya own Pro Tools
Do it like I did it, drop your nuts and make your own moves

Now am I out here on my grind? that's fasho
Mind on my money, seven days twenty-fo
Dont fuck with dumb niggas, I dont fuck with bum hoes
It ain't nothing to be done out here that I ain't done before
Teach you niggas how to ball, show you what to do with dough
Get everything you want then go back and get some mo
Can you relate? just let me know
If you ain't afraid of heights, meet me on the top floor here I go
See I been on my grind, way too many years
To let these fake rapping niggas act like they my peers
I seen em rolling dice, crap out and disappear
Say pressure bust a pipe and make a diamond and it's clear
Im nothing like them niggas telling lies in your ears
See me I really shed blood, sweat and tears
That's why everything you see, match everything you hear
And nothing last forever so enjoy me while im here
Clear
Here I go, say here I go, uh

Now am I out here on my grind? that's fasho
Mind on my money, seven days twenty-fo
Dont fuck with dumb niggas, I dont fuck with bum hoes
It ain't nothing to be done out here that I ain't done before
Teach you niggas how to ball, show you what to do with dough
Get everything you want then go back and get some mo
Can you relate? just let me know
If you ain't afraid of heights, meet me on the top floor here I goEmbed
