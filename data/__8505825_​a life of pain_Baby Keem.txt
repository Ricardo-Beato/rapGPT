A life of pain, what I think of when I caress my chain
Am I ashamed? Project, shelters, and that crack cocaine
I seen too much behind them bars of that windowpane
I seen my opp yesterday, I'm sad, I'm glad you came
Grabbed my bitch butt yesterday, I said, "I'm glad you came"
She caught me cheatin' in them pictures, I said, "I was framed"
I got taste, lil' baby, this ain't no Mulsanne
Baby, this ain't Johnny Dang
I done took a lot of careers that been in my lane (In my lane, in my lane)
Bitch, get out my way
It ain't no amount of money that could make me change
If you send your bitch my way, she'd get rearranged
Lead a whole friеnd group, I can entertain
I did my dance in arеnas and it wasn't strange
I don't do no baby Rovers, this the biggest Range (Rrr)
I'm with Bridgeway and Lil L, I got on all my chains
I can't wild out with lil' bro, he like to piss on graves
I'm only hangin' out with niggas that is potty-trained
My main bitch duckin' fame
She got no Instagram, these IG bitches surely lame
And these is eerie times and I put that on pgLangYou might also likeEmbed
