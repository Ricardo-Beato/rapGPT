32 ContributorsL8R Lyrics
Yo, you rocking with the man crook
You can get your man took quicker than your hand shook
No frontin', it’s about his paper
He a giver, I’m a taker and a fibber and a faker
You gotta spend a lot for this behavior
If it ain’t about a dollar, I’m a holler at you later

Yeah, you already know
I get the dough and it’s never slow (and it's never slow)
Let me know, and if you don’t, it’s whatever, yo
(Pay, pay, pay)
Gotta get it, gotta get, I gotta get it
You gotta spend a lot for this behavior
If it ain’t about a dollar, I’m a holler at you later

Light skin world, light skin girls
Switching his vanilla cause he likes that swirl, yeah
He like black girls and he love a musician
I'm fucking with this older nigga, he a fucking magician, son
He tricking off, cause my verse perverse
And jerking off when a bitch rehearse him
And when I lift the skirt, your nigga never gotta be coerced
To just squirt and he eats the dessert and that’s some real shit
I mean real tits, nice ass, tight twat
Dome fucking up a nigga home, call a bitch S.W.A.T
Uh, I get it tighter than a gridlock
Open your face and let a bitch squat
I tell him you should let his bitch watch
Cause she wanna kiss, nah
I tell her she could lick this box
Cause I ain’t really with that dick-swap
Even if you switch socks
Bitch is fishier than Chip Shop
And he was praying that her shit pop
Every time I say deeper, I get it warmer than a space heater
No ordinary taste either, it's that candy
He was tryna lick it off the seam of my panties
I was tryna kick him out, but he was like can he-
Eat a little dinner, want to sit with my family
Nah, there's probably not a lot in this container
If it ain’t about a dollar, I’m a holler at you later (ha!)

Ayo, shout out all my ratchet bitches
Aha, shout out all the ratchet bitches, ratchet bitches make the world go 'round
Word up, if it wasn't for ratchet bitches, I don't know where I would be in life
*Laughing*
Yo, ratchet bitches holdin' it down
Ratchet bitches hold a nigga down more than the prissy bitches and the boujie bitches do 'cause ratchet bitches used to that bull shit
They used to gettin' life's short end of the stick so, they know how to deal with opposition
So, shout out to a- shout out to all my ratchet people
All across the world, shout out all the ratchet people
'Cause ratchetness is needed and everybody got a lil bit of ratchetness in them3Embed
