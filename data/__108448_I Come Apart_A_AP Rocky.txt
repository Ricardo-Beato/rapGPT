1 ContributorIcy (Freestyle) LyricsI got the switch
Uh, fucking on this lil Bape, nigga I got the drip
They told me that I fell off
Now I'm saying I don't give a fuck
Bitch, suck my dick, BFG game in the tuck
(Like aye), I'm killing all these motherfucking rappers
Sick of these fucking mumbling people, no Mac but I'm Lethal
Gotta get it get it get it, and I gotta fucking play like I'm rolling dice
My mindset will kill you and your wife
Like aye, I been rapping independent
It's Reem Da Illist, niggas know me
Gettin' shit off my chest, haven't dropped nun in a minute
Reminiscing, do a song wit' Logic
I'm the greatest
People calling me the G.O.A.T
I be bussing them checks like a motherfucking AP
Dick eaters, G.E.T. off my dick please
Get a GED, I be in the office at the G.O.P., uh
You do not understand me, I don't fuck witchu
I just been getting this money tho
I came from the Area, Butterfly Symphony
Dirfinesse gon get it poppin tho
Thanking the Lord Above, go get the diamonds
And jewels, you think you kell's
Been killing these niggas, puttin' yellow tape
No Chris, but I'm rocking the Louie and Bape lil bitch
Who think they harder
Cooking up hits like I'm lil Dwayne Carter
Give you this fade like a barber
Boy you look like Jason
Like Tory Lanez wit' hairline replacement
Ha, fitna go litty again
Nigga I'm the Master of Disguise like I'm Ben 10
Fucking all the bitches and I'm never quiting
Shit is like a Homicide
"Fuck rap, bussin' like a Semi automatic"
I got a dangerous mind, yeah
Lil bro look like YNW BSlime
Shoutout to my slime
Lil Jayy, he the next up
So he get em wit' the AK
Got me breaking down the beat
Slowing the pace, no meet and greet
Feel like I'm Crypt cuz I am angry
You in a casket, the Eulogy
Wait, ok
I love when people talk about it
It make me go Rambo
No cameras, no paparazzi, Lady Gaga
Talk out ya neck
Mouth (yada yada)
You thought I was finished?
24 months left for 6ix9ine in Prison
Nigga a dummy
6ix, Go row your boat
No Georgie, but these little niggas a joke
That's how I spoke
Imma just stay on this topic
Glock is popping, nun you niggas ain't rocking
Nick Cannon tryna call my mans Em out
Who gave you back your rapping privileges, nigga
I got 6 figures
I am loyal, Forever Committed
The family gonna watch how I get it
Love this instrumental, (yeah), cuz I'm feeling icy
Run to the top, feel like I'm Rocky
Making decisions, something like Rotimi
Hereditary, shit is apart of me
I cannot stop and that's how it gotta be
I'm feeling proud of me
I got the shooters beside of me
Get em a hearse cuz I'm dropping dead bodies
I can't breath, someone come stop me
Done wit' this shit, need a lumbotomy bitchYou might also like3Embed
