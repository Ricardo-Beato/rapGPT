Yeah man, you know
2002, man
You know, approachin' 2003, man
Where we takin' this, man, you know what I'm sayin
Where we headed for the future man? (What's the resolutions?)

Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Will Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral ceilings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to C-Span, see the elite strength
Attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dunn, it's nothin' to laugh at
I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death, I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? C'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees
You might also like
Saw alot of niggas die, some niggas survived
And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that 456
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a nigga's problems had no one to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line, them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B
And it's real

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death, I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? C'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees
I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'mma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker
Dawg, you were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin', jumpin' out of bed
Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the carpets

I traveled the world, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself
You got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death, I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? C'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees2Embed
