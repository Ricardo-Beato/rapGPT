15 ContributorsSay What U Want Lyrics
Yo, niggas be asking me "Yo 50, who you got beef with?"
I'ma tell y'all niggas straight up who I got beef with, right
Man, I got beef wit e'rybody I can't make no money with, know what I mean?
If I can't make no money wit' you, fuck you nigga!
G-Unit nigga!
That's what's up cause I said that's what's up

I gets money, money I got
So its a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little doja
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed to
Heavy pistol shells'll lift you
My gun tear through lungs and it rip through tissue
While I'm out for them ends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black Lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the car lot
I got the gift of articulate speeches
So I'm gon' sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
But deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
Cause we got them three B's: Benzes, burners, and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches
You might also like
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

Lately, I been going through a phase
Hoping they ain't tapped the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore, I'm on the move from the squad
I'm stingy as ever, only trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
I'd rather put shoes on the card
And a pool in the yard
You don't really wanna fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game, you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing? You gotta be strapped to get rid of me
I'll leave you in water like the Statue of Liberty
I'm tryin' to be cool
Blowin' green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out

Y'all niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)
Y'all niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)
What I learned from watching Brucie B
Look, I shot the sheriff
And nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot
Here's the plan, I'ma keep stackin' my ends
Till I'm on airplane seats and the Maybachs benz
I'm all about the chips
I done took them trips
22's on the 6
26 on the bricks
And them outta town niggas, I'm chargin' them more
I tapdance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw
You sell smoke, look, nigga, I got what you need
But it ain't goin' cheap cause I got mouths to feed
Niggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged
Cause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug
Bring me his watch and his chain
We're not the same, he's a lame
He want pussy I'm bout my money man
Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick
Threw a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed
Yo it's 50, when your mindframe change and you start to run away
I'll see you another day motherfucker, it's 50
When them shots go off and your heart drop, nigga freeze up, ease up, motherfucker it's 50
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out2Embed
