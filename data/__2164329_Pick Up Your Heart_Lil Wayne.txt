She on her back screaming she love me, yeah
And I'm in her pussy thinking 'bout money, mmm
I done forgot what all my old hoes look like
But they see me with my new bitch, make 'em miss the good life
I moved to Cali, had to leave the beach alone
And you could call me what you want
Just don't call me on speaker phone
And the good die young
And the great live forever
Go see your memory bank teller
'Cause you done forgot who put this shit together
Wait, bitch

I hop in my Phantom and drive 'til my phone start roamin', yeah
Lord, I don't wan' talk to nobody, I want my moment, yeah
Please pardon my restroom, but Tunechi got the longest shit list, uh
My pockets are pregnant, they up early with morning sickness
I swear, ooh, I been through so much
But that's life, I get high, it don't phase me, no
They ask, how do you sleep at night?
I reply, like a baby, bitch
I been out here doing me by myself, nigga, no special features
It's all about the Benjamins, no disrespect to Aretha
You might also like
But I gotta get that paper, baby, that paper, baby
That paper, baby, that paper, baby
'Cause this game fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody
Gotta get that paper, baby, that paper, baby, that paper, babe
Yeah, 'cause these streets fuck everybody, these streets fuck everybody
Gotta get my paper, babe, my paper, babe, my paper, babe
Yeah, 'cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
Gotta get my paper, baby, my paper, baby, my paper, baby
Yeah, 'cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, wait, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no
But I gotta get my paper, babe, uh

Perfect attendance on the block, I'm boomin', yeah
When it's cold, when it's rainy
When it's muggy, when it's hot, when it's humid, oh
I walk into the corner store feeling like a king
World on my back, shit feel like a mink
Mad at some motherfucker dropped my pill down the sink
Hold up, wait
I got Xanax, I got Percocet, yeah
She give me pussy and her income tax, yeah
I send my goons to rob the dope man, lawd
They bring it back, now I'm the dope man
Suitcase, dead body in the suitcase, yeah
Molly in the Kool-Aid, we put molly in the Kool-Aid, uh
I'm still watching bootlegs 'cause I can't go to the movies
'Cause I'm bigger than the actors in the movies
Me and your bitch made a movie, yeah
Ooh, I'm on a new wave
I been wilding in these streets, mama
But still remember everything you said to me
Don't believe these hoes, they be lying through they teeth, mama
Toothache
Oh Lord, I gotta get that paper
'Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, wait, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no

Wait, bitch
I hop in the Bentley and drive 'til my phone start roamin'
Lord, I don't wan' talk to nobody, I want my moment, yeah
I used to be fun-loving, now I'm a gun-loving killer
But these niggas made me like this
Now they all afraid of they own invention
I walk with a limp
'Cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight
I've come to a stage in my life
And I just can't let my life boo me off stage, no
Tuxedo on and a cumberbund
Fingers crossed behind my back
On the corner, watching my money come

'Cause I gotta get that paper, baby, that paper, baby
That paper, baby, that paper, babe
'Cause these streets fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody
Gotta get my paper, baby, my paper, baby, my paper, babe
Yeah, 'cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, wait, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more
I wear black 'cause I can't find nothing else to wear
I wear dreadlocks 'cause I can't do nothing else to my hair
I kiss you 'cause it just happen
I do what I do 'cause it gotta be done
But I guess I oughta start taking credit for something, right
(Mula)
Yesterday, I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there again today
I really hope she go away
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't wanna do it no more)
'Cause you know, sometimes "at last" doesn't happen at first (Yeah)
I'm the pimp and the problem (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She said, "You don't think of me when I know you think too much"
Hmm (I don't wanna do it no more)
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody)
(And I don't wanna do it no more)
She said "I think you think I think you think of us," hmm
(I'ma get this paper, baby, I'ma get this paper, baby)
She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners
