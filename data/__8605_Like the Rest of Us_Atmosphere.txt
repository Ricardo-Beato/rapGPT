26 ContributorsLike the Rest of Us Lyrics
See, I've been here for thirty-some years
Lookin' at myself in the same dirty mirror
So it ain't like I don't comprehend
Open that bottle, swallow that friend
No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it if somebody else has it

Go do that shit, do that shit, lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester, I see the kid kick
She showed me outside when she gave me a cigarette
Shit, there's no way to measure it
Not every pony grows up to be a Pegasus
Ya gotta let people be hypocrites
Count your blessin's and mind yo business

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
Let me fly 'way, Heaven won't wait
Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
Let me fly 'way, Heaven won't wait
You might also like
Heaven won't wait, let me fly 'way
Get in my way, everyday
Heaven won't wait, let me fly 'way
Get in my way, everyday

Just tryna keep my mind on work
It's like that's the only way to love this life on Earth
It's like everyone takes number one in the race
'Cause we all keep runnin' in place
Here kitty kitty, can't train that fox
Must be drinkin' that name brand scotch
All of us cut from the same damn cloth
Some of us never cut the price tags off

She ended up on the pole
With her heels pointin' at her Jesus she used to know
Stripped her down to her naked body
We made her drown in a lake full of patriarchy
In between the pride and the misery
With the infinite supply of sympathy
Are these invisible walls that hold me
Like this goldfish bowl is the whole sea
Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
Let me fly 'way, Heaven won't wait
Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
Let me fly 'way, Heaven won't wait

Heaven won't wait, let me fly 'way
Get in my way, everyday
Heaven won't wait, let me fly 'way
Get in my way, everyday1Embed
