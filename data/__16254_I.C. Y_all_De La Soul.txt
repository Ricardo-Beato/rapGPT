8 ContributorsI.C. Yâ€™all Lyrics
Yeah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Flipmode, y'all, what you talkin' 'bout?
De La, y'all, what you talkin' 'bout?
What you talkin' 'bout?

Yo, you gettin' stomped by the marching band
Keep 'em shook like spray cans (It's so hot)
It's so hot it'll make your face tan (Ooh)
Ace ban rap, the place the wasteland (Uh-huh)
Bit y'all in my mouth, but you taste bland
I feel fake niggas and mince these snake niggas
That hiss but won't bite, false alarm
And if it don't rock wild, we finna drop a bomb (Word up)
Strong grip on a mic like we Stretch Arm'
I been shine, you been warned and been torn
Get smacked for the B.S. you been on
Storm bad whether or not you stay scorned
For ten years, I've baked shit like hot potato
Rhymes still drippin' like stu B's, you groupies
Need to show I.D. before the bust down
Touched down, the God put seven to your Zippo
And drop it on you heavy like a hippo (Now you heard that?)
You might also like
To all my dogs all the way in the back ready to black, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all
Ladies, get down, shake your ass around, I hope you know that I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
To all my soldiers on the corner, I see y'all (See y'all)
Women doin' what they wanna, I see y'all
To them people gettin' pulled over, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
Wouldn't wanna be y'all (Be y'all)

It's the one and only effect that you catch from a cassette
Straight wig out the world, and girls, we straight dig out your back (Ha)
With letters spellin' out my name
All over your marquee 'cause the spark is me
Currently, we can be seen across your screen
Stayin' wide-eyed 'cause you niggas tryin' to scheme
Welcome to the spot, I'm slaying with it
Chopped up and fitted inside your quart of rice
You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device
Tryin' to give me third degree, you just a third of me (Woo)
Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me
A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D
Who quoted Vance Wright, no one can serve us
My squad advance heights quite superb
Just kick off your shoes, jump on the jock
It's been a long time comin', this, you need to cop
To all my dogs all the way in the back ready to black, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all
Ladies, get down, shake your ass around, I hope you know that I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
To all my soldiers on the corner, I see y'all (See y'all)
Women doin' what they wanna, I see y'all
To them people gettin' pulled over, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
Wouldn't wanna be y'all (Be y'all)

It goes one (One), two (Two), three (Three), four (Four)
Bounce so much, I ricochet up off the floor (Floor)
So raw, shit, the most raw you ever saw
Quarter after four, niggas quick to bust the back door
Baby, open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse
Quick Jamaican dick style all in they house
I practice to be the all access, you see, the fact is
My mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness
Yo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums
When I was young, moms put soap on my tongue
Ayo, yo, forever we gettin' this cheddar with the quickness
I'ma cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness
Short fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes
We gettin' money with whoever, even the Jews
The way we finagle and gain, it must be all in my shoes
Fuck a nigga up with De La like back and amused
To all my dogs all the way in the back ready to black, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all
Ladies, get down, shake your ass around, I hope you know that I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
To all my soldiers on the corner, I see y'all (See y'all)
Women doin' what they wanna, I see y'all
To them people gettin' pulled over, I see y'all (See y'all)
I see y'all (See y'all)
Wouldn't wanna be y'all (Be y'all)Embed
