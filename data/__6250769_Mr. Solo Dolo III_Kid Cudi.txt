109 ContributorsMr. Solo Dolo III Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, every bottle
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woah, woah, ah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream
Somethin' twisted in me

Say, "I'm waitin' to die," I cry
Many nights I spent gettin' fucked up, livin' a lie
Prayin', I'm just fed up, this tequila in me
Don't tell me to be cool, this is how cool I can be, woah
You can try and read my mind
Been pushin' it for days, I'm on a mission to climb, woah
Losin' rеality, been sayin' I'm fine, try my hardest to sleep
Too many issues bubblin', say I'll work through it
How? Think thеy knowin' what the problems are
Had me goin' crazed through the city while I burn it down
This is just my way, keep on prayin' for me
Lonely on my ride as I fly, arms is open wide
Don't wanna leave without sayin' bye
Had a rough night, finna sip some
Don't even worry 'bout it, waitin' 'til the Devil comes
You might also like
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream (Ahh!)

He's callin' me
So much gone while I blow off steam
And the shit's the same
Oh, look at that, only you to blame (Ha)
It's like I'm swimmin' towards another bona fide life
It's like a fairy tale, wantin' more
But inside I'm vexed, used to question, why
Lord, he show me that I'm tested and I'm gonna fly
I ain't slippin', no, that's not for me
Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me, Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets
Somethin' else, how it felt
Take a drink, I live in excess, nothin' left
Every minute slippin' away, this is hell
They were warning him, figured he'd be cool, who's the fool?
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody (Yeah, yeah)
Deep in Hell in dark corners (Yeah)
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah (Yeah)
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody (Yeah)
Can't hear me scream (Scream)
