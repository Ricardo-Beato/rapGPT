DY Krazy

Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm sixty-six

Ayy, ayy
Flexin' forty bands from the pop out, ayy
Boolin' on the block I got my Glock out, ayy
I just pulled up in a Bentley
All the hatred go right to your fuckin' kidney
Flexin' bands, lil' nigga won't get a penny, yeah
I'ma keep on runnin' it up, ayy
I'ma keep on runnin' it up, fuckin' it up
This choppa bustin' you up, ayy
There you go, testin' your luck, dumb as fuck, yeah (Ayy, ooh)
Flexin' baby, pull up in a drop top, ayy
Diamonds dancin' on me, baby hopscotch
Bling blaow, shinin' fresh just like some Pop Rocks, ayy
Fireworks, when I pull up to your block, pop

Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm sixty-six
Racks up, racks up, pullin' up, Bentley truck
Semi, semi, keep it tucked, bad bitch, bubble butt
14, 14, high school, servin' beans
Dropped out, now I'm rich, flexin' 'til I'm sixty-six
