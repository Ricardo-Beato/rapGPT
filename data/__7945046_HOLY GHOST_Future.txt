This some real Pluto shit, nigga
Out the muhfuckin' mud, nigga, you know what I'm saying?
Out the dirt, nigga, out the soil of this shit
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob
Yeah

Phantom like a cigarette boat, all this water on me
I was at my big truck, my wrist up, gettin' my dick sucked
When I switch my wrist up, switch my car, switch my bitch up
Every time I hit her, I broke her off then dismissed her
I been counting this paper all day, I'm getting blisters
Roadkill, every time I pop out in a new whip
Gettin' you whacked, niggas ain't running off with my new drip
Rose set, white set, platinum set, overkill
Killed shit and the nigga ain't have nothing to do with it, over-drill
When you in the field and you innocent, why you over here?
Body count, protocol, thotty count, losing count
Swiss account, large amount, overseas, can't pronounce
Sippin' syrup in a fur, get my dog, walk him down
Details inside of the photo, my fit was twenty thou'
No miles, cashed out, put it up by the time it hit two thou'
Surfing in Hermès, I'm the one they call Pluto-ski
Mitski, I just went so deep I made her nose bleed
Lewinsky, she just gave me her throat inside the Rolls-y
If I OD, I'ma be on a Bentley spree, you must not know me
I gave her that dope, put her on the road, she was holy
Me and my lil' woadie gettin' it in, Japanese trend
Big top Maybach, Benz, buy 'em buy the twin
We got 'em locked in, boxed in, Glocks in
Alligator skin for my sins, I'm 'bout to win again
I know niggas craving for bodies, ready to spin again
I get on my ten, 'bout my ends, nigga, I'm locked in
Made an M to a ten, now I'm posted on the Forbes again
Only time I sell out, at the show, bitch, I'm European
Top ten, that's without that melody, it's costing
No sleep, come from out the streets, leave you in white sheets
V.I.P., bitch tryna eat on me, tryna sleep with me
Overseas, everything I'm spending, Gucci on the feet
Only see, everything this month, I bought an Onlysea
New Chanel, everything I say, these bitches oversee
Rolls key, pass the Lambo key, and the other key
Truck key, not the sedan key, that's the other key
Wiped down, cleaning my cars in the rain, I got OCD
Dry it off, pouring out rain and he tryna dry it off
Slide off, I got a foreign bitch at my hideout
Real talk, niggas ain't speaking the language I talk
