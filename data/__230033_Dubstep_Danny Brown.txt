38 ContributorsDubstep Lyrics
I was thinking 'bout something, but I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Remember when I was struggling, fucked up on my knuckles
Tryna sell some dirt weed, taxing off a ten speed
Money wasn't coming, for sure nigga I kept fronting

I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way

And I kept licking on that clit 'til she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long, swear to God I gotta get it
I put my back into it, serving bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire on that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryna get my mind, go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rolling up that Swisher, pouring up a four
Serving in them hallways, the courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down, now we in the Coney

I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
Slow days, fast days, getting paper any way
It's the same old shit
Everybody in the manor is locked up, boxed up
It's killing me, niggas wanna get rid of me
Cause I lyrically bust on the riddim, fill the room with humidity
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm banging out
Doubling my money getting my hustle in Canning Town
Listen up Danny Brown, I been doing this thing
Skipped in, then I come and lyrically assist 'em
(I had my dubs on the step)
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, flipping the truth
While you're running and chatting, thinking you're realer than Screw
You ain't so why you act, dummy, you think you bad, well that's funny
I'm tryna get Maybach money, I'm a Mac Miller, spitting A$AP Rocky

I had them dubs on the step4Embed
