5 ContributorsMy God Lyrics
Come on and sit down baby
I'm gonna tell you a story
I want to tell you a story about a man that's been so good to me
And when telling this story
I hope it bless you
Because I want you to sit your kids down, and tell them this story

Back when I was a little boy, you see
My life wasn't always perfect (perfect)
I remember my grandma praying
And she said one day it'll be worth it (worth it)
She said, "Sit yourself down and listen to me
And let me tell you a little story
This story won't take to long
But I'ma tell you about his glory,"
She said

My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need
You might also like
I said it happened sixty years ago
When I was washed up in his blood
Saved my soul and he set me free
Now I'm praising the lord above
I never thought that I could change
Until he saved a wretch like me
Now I'm here to tell the story
So that that you will be set free!

Well once upon a time in the Church of God
There was sinners and saints
Evens to odds
Do's and don'ts
Wills and won'ts
The haves to the have-nots
Will be sittin' up front
Gettin' the sermon up close
 the reverend  the offerings
We live in a benevolent lifetime, so stay right
I'm preachin' 'em teachin' 'em givin' em more than a look
My granny raised me right about the Good Book

I said, My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I need
My God!
Is the man that died for me
My God!
Said he gave me victory
My God!
Will supply your every need
My God!
His love is all I needEmbed
