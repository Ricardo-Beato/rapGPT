22 ContributorsMs. Nasty Lyrics
Real motherfuckin' pimp-bitch shit (Diego)
Young Tina Snow goin' hard on a ho (B-B-Bankroll got it)

I want you to dog this cat out, whip it like a trap house
Stand up in that pussy, stomp the yard like a frat house
Put me on the wall, spread it open, do a pat down (Pat down)
Panties to the side, don't be shy, open wide, 'cause I'm

Ms. Nasty, tat it on my ass cheek (Tat it on my ass cheeks)
Scared to put that pussy on him 'cause he might harass me (Might harass me, ah)
Ms. Nasty, everywhere the cash be
Crop me out that picture 'cause my nigga gon' be spazzin' (Ayy)

Leave that sexy shit to me, y'all can ride 'round with them Glocks
You ain't comin' 'cause she hold the dick the way she hold a Glock (Baow-baow-baow)
Bitch, this ain't musical chairs, I ain't fightin' for no spot (For no spot)
I'm a bitch your nigga want, ho, stop callin' me your opp (Ah)
P-I-M-P, put it in my pocket (Put it in my pocket)
If it ain't 'bout my money or me nuttin', we ain't talkin' (Nope)
Put me in a 'Vette if you tryna get it wet, ayy (Ah)
New Maybach if you wanna see it clap (Ayy, ah)

I want you to dog this cat out, whip it like a trap house (Trap house)
Stand up in that pussy, stomp the yard like a frat house
Put me on the wall, spread it open, do a pat down (Pat down)
Panties to the side, don't be shy, open wide, 'cause I'm

Ms. Nasty, tat it on my ass cheek (Tat it on my ass cheeks)
Scared to put that pussy on him 'cause he might harass me (Baow-baow-baow, ah)
Ms. Nasty, everywhere the cash be (Hey)
Crop me out that picture 'cause my nigga gon' be spazzin'

Suckin' on that pussy from the back, yeah
Only gangster niggas get it wet, splat
Talkin' all that shit in my ear, ayy
You want me to act right? Nigga, make it clear
I'm from the South, it's only right I keep it pimpin' (I keep it pimpin')
It really ain't my business what you do with other women
As long as I'm fed and my pockets stay full
I ain't fuckin' up the bag tryna act a damn fool (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

'Cause I want you to dog this cat out, whip it like a trap house (Trap house)
Stand up in that pussy, stomp the yard like a frat house
Put me on the wall, spread it open, do a pat down (Pat down)
Panties to the side, don't be shy, open wide, 'cause I'm
Ms. Nasty, tat it on my ass cheek (Tat it on my ass cheeks)
Scared to put that pussy on him 'cause he might harass me (Ah)
Ms. Nasty, everywhere the cash be (Baow-baow-baow)
Crop me out that picture 'cause my nigga gon' be spazzin' (Ah)Embed
