8 ContributorsBoy Meets Girl LyricsYo, this kid was raised to hustle
All he ever known was trouble
His mama never kept a job his daddy died in struggle
He had a sister cute as fuck that liked this older cat
That had control over the hood, but never sold a pack
The family needed money, asking him if he could fronted
He wants to learn the game, cause being broke ain't feed em nothing
They met and talked him in, and one more thing before we finish
You don't know me I don't know you thats how we'll start and end it
From there he's off and running, taught him how to save his money
Never let one meet the other don't meet paper bleed and run it
You'll learn the basic rules, don't sell this to kids or fools
And don't you try it either, honor that and all is cool
Now he a baller dude, strippin hoes are callin dude
Addicted to the boy, shootin up and snorting too

Boy meets girl, and falls in love
In this world of hate and war
Girl meets boy, and falls in love
So let stay together, play together days forever babe
Ok, a deeper subject, titty dances seen in public
Daytime she's off in school, trying to get a degree in something
She's beautiful, after all that she's been thru
I heard he father used to rape the girl and beat her too
A man a wife a kid, a car a dog and crib
The perfect world if you was outside, you was looking in
Somehow she got the blame, kicked her out the house and rain
Began to fall and no one ever thought she'd be the same
Her hate for men was evident, but it was prevalent
Cause where she worked had dudes that always asked her, to come home with them
Ain't look for love but fell in love inside a topless club
She met a thug, that had the drug, and that was all it was
You might also like
Boy meets girl, and falls in love
In this world of hate and war
Girl meets boy, and falls in love
So let stay together, play together days forever babe
This match was made in heaven, girl meets boy and stayed together
A feeling never known to either, this could be forever
Addiction follows, so in love that all the leaves are hollow
Plus nothing else exists, just speed ball and the needle swallow
A mix of different worlds, I know you thought when boy met girl
That this meant no regrets, but Romeo let Juliet
Say those words that and made him think that it was cool to try
But you know you don't get high, on what you supply
And heroin's next to kin, ain't a bag of coke
But when her world met up with his they both was comatose'd
A tragic ending, to a couple, that was oh so close
Stopped short a happiness, cause they combined and overdosedEmbed
