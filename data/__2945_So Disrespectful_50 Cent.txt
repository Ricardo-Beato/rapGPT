53 ContributorsSo Disrespectful Lyrics
I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful

Your daddy fucked your momma, then fucked your sister
Then climbed in your bed, playing with your shitter
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter of fact, grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick, you know, the one everybody on
You 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was the Case''
Bullets ricochet, *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face
I'm international, I'm never home, mane
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with, mate
Or you gon' make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on, Game, you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See, me, I'm what you never gon' be
I'm in that tax bracket you never gon' see

When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful

That nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C
Man, keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs didn't sell like his CDs
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look, I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, nah, don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper, now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on me 'cause them, they need me
See, me, I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun
I catch you and you done, you pussy, nigga, run

When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead, I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage
Then came the cash, then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill', she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man, I can't even flaunt shit 'cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, damn, even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'ma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Start screaming "Westside" and Dre ain't say shit
Now we just eat off him and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me "Here's the case
Enemies stay enemies, but friends, they change"
Niggas go crazy over money, my man

When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful14Embed
