11 ContributorsThat Pack Lyrics
My bank got bigger, the kid got richer
Multi-millionaire but I'm the same old nigga
Never find a nigga with a watch more sicker
Or a rapper nigga spit this game mo slicker
That's yo tender after I hit her
Heard that she broke up with ya own Twitter
I love to suck dick till her face turn bitter
Try to cut her off but I can't get rid a her
Use a ban for a bed, use a brick for a pillow
Bag on yo head, best friend turned killa
Riding in the foreign, steering wheel in the middle
Car jacker, bet to reconsider
Diamonds on my wrist, I'm a hand it out the window
Presidential endo, smell it when the wind blow
4's on my Charger, I drive it like an Enzo
When bricks touch down I'll be dancing in the end zone
6 months gone, would've thought I would've been home
Keep the Barney with me like my last name Flintstone
Never disrespect the street shit that I pimp on
Put a tune out, now yo ass gotta limp home
Squares came in and they move with Benito
Run up on the kid then yo ass is finito
Easy to me, shoot yo ass like a free throw
2 Glock 9's up under the peacoat

This pack right here, strongest in the town
VVS diamond cost a couple thou
Checker board gear hard Louie down
Always showin out when we be steppin out
This chick right here? Baddest for a while
How much we spending at Onyx? A couple thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Phipps, bitch I'm cashing out

20 packs, 20 days, 40K in diamonds
Shawty got her shades on, still see me shinin
Pack touched down, I'm a bust it down asap
Rocky ass wrists so you know I gotta stay strapped
Always stay in Louie bitch, like i get it wholesale
Swerve up to the trap, tell em throw an O on the scale
Yeah - I'm international
Old school Chevelle, I'm skatin out or a national
You's the type a nigga love a bitch and take her to your place
I'm the type of nigga wake up in the morning 100K
Count it up, Louie sneakers on it, you should see the lace
Bezel cost a couple K, I just got this shit yesterday

This pack right here, skrongest in the town
VVS diamond cost a couple thou
Checker board gear hard Louie down
Always showin out when we be steppin out
This chick right here? Baddest for a while
How much we spending at Onyx? A couple thou
We pull up in them foreigns, I'm smashing out
Then spend a grip in Phipps, bitch I'm cashing outEmbed
