29 ContributorsCarrera  Lu Lyrics
Carrera's a predator
Collector of the best of the Ericas, Rebeccas, etcetera
Set in my way!

One for the money, and two for the base
Three for the bail, and four for the case
I hops out in my militant way
Fresh Puerto Rican Airs, green Michigan J
Hello my ladies, hello my honeys
Feast Your eyes 'pon feminine prey
Go (Carrera's a predator
Collector of the best of the Ericas, Rebeccas, etcetera
Set in my way, yeah)
Yes I move, I agree
I get to it, I'm more faster, lowkey
Like C-O-G, go backwards, me
I ain't trippin but you simpin'
Running around like a chicken with his head cut off
Well I be pimping, I be limping like a chicken with his leg cut off
The amputee, the man with

You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm 'bout my money, 'bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
'Cause you speeding
(I'm 'bout my money, 'bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)

The Fifteenth is me, the First is for Chill
12s for the toast and 20s for the wheels
Something for the cash and something for the bills
Representing for my New Jacks and all my Jills
Nice, real, tight
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, now
Back to my powers, my prowess
For moving the powders, my accolades
Don't put your alkaloids
All burned like aftershave right after fades
Boy, learn, quick
Might trip over spike strips
That's just a slight story
Inflate my white walls, reinstate the eyeball then I tip

You best, slow down
'Cause you speeding
(I'm 'bout my money, 'bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
'Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)
Ichi for my city
And ni for my hood
San for the bad
And shi for the good
Go a dub for your addictions
Pennies for my thoughts, quarters for the flipping
Ten thousand dollars for my description
If it leads to a conviction
All that for tipping, half a mil for my depiction
And just fourteen-ninety nine to listen
Nerd, I heard that
Four Eyes, been called that before
They just jealous
Oyster Perpetuals, four I's for four
Chillin in my race car, gorilla like Bapestar
I lay law, I'm a villain and I break heart
And I ain't into offending no feelings
And if I did it, just means that you been chillin
With the great, Carrera, Lu

You best, slow down
'Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
'Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper)
('Bout my money, Joe)
I'm 'bout my money, 'bout my paper
'Bout my money, JoeEmbed
