78 ContributorsThoughts from a Balcony Lyrics
It was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Ugh

Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? (Heh)
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine

Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the—, what the fuck is time? (Heh)
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
