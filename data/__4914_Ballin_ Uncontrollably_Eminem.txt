Me and my crew... yeah—we gots money, baby
I'm talkin' 'bout... I'm talkin' 'bout that long money
When you see us come through, just know—

Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba-ba-controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably

Man, I got everything candy-painted, candy-painted tint
It's so dark, I'd be lyin' if I said I ain't hit at least nine of my friends
Plus, I got so much candy paint on my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car, be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, "There go the candy man"
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, them shits look like the Batmobile
Thirty-two-inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat? Custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, "Ah, there go them superstars!"
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash
But I ain't buyin' shit, bitch, kiss my candy-painted ass, we—

Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba-ba-controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably (Yeah)
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Hit the corner liquor store to get Corona, tip the owners
Sipped it on the way out as I dip, I wanna rip the road up
And I'ma hit the cinema and I'ma get the hoes
'Cause when I be at a theater, shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
These bitches don't get a crumb
And it cum but I'm like, "What up?"
Shut up, bitch! Sit up, get up off them knees, my candy paint's enough!
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Then I'ma split, disappear, and a cloud of smoke is all you see

Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba-ba-controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck
I'm horny as fuck, bitch, are you suckin' my dick or what?
I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch?
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz? Bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck? Do you think that colostomy bag is for looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make-A-Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' brat, get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'ma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run, take this gun and cover me, Slater
And quit your—

Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ba-ba-ba-controllably
Ballin' uncontrollably, ballin' uncontrollably
Ballin' uncontrollably ba-ballin' uncontrollably
"Tracy, I joined this class 'cause I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she's never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work"
"I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth"
"I know, but I'm over here in my unit every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan
I mean, look at him, it looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my entire life
And, I'm just saying, I wash and dry, I'm like, a single mother
And no offense, but everyone takes this class to get an A and it's bullshit, but uh, no offense, I'm just saying
And I'm not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu?
Am I gonna be a chef? No
There's three weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing"
"Oh my god, that's like the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my life!
It's insane! Can you tell us again? Do you have time?
Tracy? Tracy! Can you hear me? I'm in the car right now
Listen, I am McLovin, yeah
McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah!"14Embed
