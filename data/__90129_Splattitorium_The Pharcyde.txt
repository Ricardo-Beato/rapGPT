Rollin' herbals for the verbals
Extractions and distractions

If I had another sack, I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around
If I had another sack I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around

Joints, blunts and a bong
Any which way, I can never go wrong
I smoke bud all night, all day, all night
Whatever time, it's the right time for me
You know what time it is
I'm down with tha P.H.A.R Cyde (yeah, yeah)
(Tenue to rock the venue) I never hide my feelings
(I got the microphone I'll twist you and bend you and send you)I have the yearnin' for the burnin'
Back, away, run away, run away, run away
Days are getting longer
The brain is gettin' stronger
Yeah, this is not a test
No more teachers
No more bitches no more hoes
And that's how it goes

Leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
I want some respect
Leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
Check, check, respect
Leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
I wanna a check, I want some respect
I want some leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
I want respect, I wanna check
I want some leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
I wanna check, I wanna check
I want some respect, I want some respect
I want some leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop
I wanna check, check
I want some respect, 'spect
I want some leathers and a coupe and a house full of loot
That'll make ya just gotta get a scoop2Embed
