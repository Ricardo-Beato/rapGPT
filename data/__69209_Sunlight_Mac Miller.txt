Check it out
Uh-ah-ah, top of the morning to you
You know, it's been so dark outside
That Iâ€”that I figured I'd turn a couple motherfuckin' lights on real quick

Uh
I ain't talkin 'bout nothin' with a flow so disgutin'
Ashtray by me that I gotta dump my guts in
Need substance, feed it to the public
No one gon' touch it like my Poppy's old musket
Roll up to the function, eatin' all the Funyuns
Sentence keep runnin', word to double E Cummings
When people say to me it doesn't mean nothin'
Bumblebees buzzin' 'cause the trouble needs lovin'
Wonder who really give a fuck what I have to say?
Those are the people to which I dedicate this rap today
Your shit is fragile, if I have to I'ma crack your face
Monday to Saturday, I'm actin' like a basket case
While Sunday I'm goin' golfin' with my Callaway's
Or watchin' football, word to Joey Galloway
Take a shower, start singin' like Al Green
From outside, it probably sound like some loud screams
Always had child dreams and nightmares
My music like the airport, I hop on a flight there
Wanna go to Monaco to see what it's like there
Roll up in a pair of Nike Airs, just like, "Yeah
Wassup?" Here I am, lookin' in the mirror and
All I see is me, I'm at peace
Go rent out a penthouse, forget all my problems
The things I regret now, be gone by the mornin'
My life is startin', I'm ready as I ever been
Pencilin' my schedule that I gotta move on from mistakes
Number One albums, always givin' you mixtapes
And that's what I'ma do until I'm richer than Bill Gates
It ain't all about money for me, though
I do this for the people who need a boost in their ego
Work a lot, I'm an addict not a fiend, though
Get up, get out, and get somethin', word to Cee Lo
Bottles of Clicquot, a couple of Cristal
May head to L.A. like I'm Chris Paul
'Bout to go platinum off of "Missed Calls"
So all of y'all can lick balls, ha ha
Yeah
Just, you know
You might also like
Run from the dark
And into the light
You know, you know
You're gonna find your way out
Run from the dark
And into the light
Oh-woah, you know
You're gonna find your way
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight
Just run to the sunlight4Embed
