Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don't get me wrong, it's not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned
Home skillet, there's water inside, don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky, funky, smelly, green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong, y'all
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a—

Let's smoke that bowl
Hit the bong and then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don't strain
I love you, Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She's so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl, I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bubbling
Water is makin' it pure, so I got to
Take my hit and hold it
Just like Chong, I get the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
This shit'll straighten your dick out
Can I get a hit?16Embed
