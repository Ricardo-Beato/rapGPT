18 ContributorsThe Future is Now Lyrics
No longer can I remain earthbound
The future is now
Time and space are one in the same
Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension
Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception
A living lethal weapon
I'm the natural selection
Moving in my own eccentric orbit
A rebel amongst conformists
So far gone, you might catch me on Pluto
4 billion miles away
Do a whole week in one day
Live for keeping it real, you already know what it is
I rarely ever speak without something to say
But if you can't remember the who, what, when, or the how
Remember one thing I said: the future is nowYou might also like2Embed
