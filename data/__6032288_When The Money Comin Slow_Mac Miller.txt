3 ContributorsWhen The Money Comin Slow Lyrics
Ayo, haha
What's good, Rod?
Shit is cracked right here, it knocks
This to my motherfuckers who is money-hungry right now, yo
Recession is some bullshit, haha
But don't worry, we doin' this shit for the dollars, period

When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Here we go, uh)

Never start a day with empty pockets
'Cause I seek profit, keepin' work likе a office
Stick-ups, grimy shit, gettin' it all
'Cause I ain't thе type of kid with a regular job
I'm 'bout my dollars like a register be
And if the cops get him, well, he ain't get it from me
I'm never sittin' in the cell, that's a livin' hell
I'm livin' well, buildin' business, call me Stringer Bell
Uh, waitin' in the alley with my hoodie up
'Cause this rapper hustle money ain't good enough
Top dollar, it's whatever with me
'Cause I ain't about college, try and get a degree
I'm 'bout this hustle money, rap money, fast money, cash money
Get in my way and I'ma do you like a crash dummy
I act funny, but don't get up on my bad side
Leave you hospitalized, broken bones and black eyes
'Cause tax high, and sometime the cake low
So I keep a couple homies on the payroll
Roll with hundreds, you know you love it
I make dough, bigger when you poke my stomach, ha
So call me for ya needs, whatever it is
If you need a cracked beat, you get it from Blizz
Mac Miller gettin' money in my hands
And you clowns is lookin' funny when you dance, ya bitch
You might also like
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Uh, uh)

And when the money comin' slow, I'ma pack my shit
Grab a fast, take a piff, and have that flipped in a day or two
Haze and brew got me feelin' days confused
Take your loot, ante up, you gotta pay me
Empty out ya pockets, necklaces and watches
I'm fetchin' me some profit, then I'm gettin' some exotic
'Cause I ain't tryna play with my money like Monopoly
I want a happy lil' end in my biography
A lot to read, chronic greens kids will cop from me
Stockin' cheese 'til I'm doin' this hip-hop for free
Smokin' kush 'til I'm higher than astronomy
They feeds from my jams like I'm spittin' out some poppy seeds
Bars is  to make me rich
It'll blow your fuckin' mind when you take that hit
You lil' pussies ain't makin' it, take a hint
In this game, we pimps, you gotta pay me, bitch
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin thatEmbed
