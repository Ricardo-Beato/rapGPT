Nah Cube man how we gon' get somethin' how we gon' eat man?
You know you rappin' this shit we can't do no movies
My kids is lookin' at me like "What we doin' daddy? What we doin'?
Have you talked to him? Have you heard anything?"
I know this rap shit takes away a whole 2-3 years away from us gettin' doin' the movie Cube
Come on they waitin' on another Next Friday. Everywhere I go "Give me another Friday" I need somethin' Cube
I'm runnin' out
Man, I ain't gon' lie. I just bought half ounce of weed today... and...
Me and my girl bagged it up and we ready to get it out
She said we could sit over auntie's house this Friday and knock every sap
By Monday we betta sell the whole half ounce
I'm a flip that, get a whole one
Take the whole ounce, flip the other, whole ounce... by that time everybody, word of mouth is that I got Dimes & Nicks
I'm a take the whole ounce, flip it, get me 2
2, make a 4mac. I'm taking the 4mac and flippin' and I'm a have 9 of 'em.... come...
