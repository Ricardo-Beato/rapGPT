16 ContributorsScholar Lyrics
I could sprinkle you with game, but you just too fuckin' lame
I can put you up on something, but you still wouldn’t learn nothing
You know the game is to be sold mane, and not for you lames mane
I spent half of my life nigga sellin' crack cocaine
I’m a victim of the dope game, I don’t like to name names
I don’t like to name drop, I just like cocaine drops
All I do is drop tops, man I’m so god damn hot
If you got a old car, then go get a new one
If you don’t got no strap, go and get you two guns
Got a bitch so fine with me, she make me want 2 sons
I told her baby call me Mr. Never Ever Use A Coupon
Baby got that slow dome, my trap like a group home
I’m bad with niggas, but I’m good with bitches
Man Gucci Mane, so superstitious
Rag to riches, no pot to piss in
Three years goin' I ain’t seen no Christmas
Six months goin' I ain’t seein' no drought
Work so good they don’t ever get slow
Burglar bar doors on all my houses
I’mma put hardwood on all of my floors

Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, ain’t turnin' shit down but my damn collar
Police pointin' at me, tryna snag me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane ain’t never graduate but I’m a trap scholar
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, I ain't turnin' down shit but my damn collar
Police man be chasin', wanna grab me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane didn’t graduate, but guess what, I'm a trap scholar
You might also like
Hit the club I'm clean as hell, but yeah I got them dirty dollars
Drag a bitch so bad I need a god damn dog collar
Pull up in three Phantoms like I’m Creflo damn Dollar
And if your bitch with me, no need to call, don’t even bother
Limpin', screamin', pimpin', turn my trap to a damn brothel
Deep dishs pizzas on my chargers, tryna dodge every pothole
You ain’t gotta worry bout your bitch cuz your boy got her
Said she want some dick, then guess what she gon' get a whole lot of
Knock her, then I think I need a god damn El Dorado
Big face Rollie, keep it rolling, for I leave you holy moly
I’m golden, call me goldie
Can’t none of these fuck niggas hold me
I’m a young nigga but I OG
Y'all bout to turn me to the old me
And no OC, I could OD cuz I drink so much damn codeine
I’m solo, no Co-De
And this Mac 11 is my homie's
I'm up ain't talkin' bout mollies
I'm up ain't talkin' bout coffee
Don’t give a damn about you nigga and don’t give a damn about them police

Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, ain’t turnin' shit down but my damn collar
Police pointin' at me, tryna snag me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane ain’t never graduate but I’m a trap scholar
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, I ain't turnin' down shit but my damn collar
Police man be chasin', wanna grab me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane didn't graduate, but guess what, I'm a trap scholar2Embed
