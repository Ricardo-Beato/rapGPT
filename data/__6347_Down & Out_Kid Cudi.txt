Chka-chka, ah
Hit 'em
Plain Pat, what up?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I ain't playing no more
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Hey

This is my story, this is my song
If you feel it, motherfucker, you can't go wrong
To the screw-face niggas, what you on?
Get off that, get a goal and focus dog
See, I'm what you need, you fiending now
Ask around and I bet you'll figure out
How to zone and control your future, wow
Yeah, I think I'm in the future too
I'm unlike fools who proceed to choose
To be like them, I be like who
I be like me, Mister K-I-D
S-O-L-O, D-O-L-O
See, the Lord adore me, He met me halfway
"No guts, no glory", I always say
So until I reach what I came here to find
Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super-duper Scott
The one bad bitches called super-duper lame
Now super-duper fame gets me super-duper brains
86 the cape, but I'm super-duper high
Soaring past the moon, a super-duper lonely guy
You might also like
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in

For even in Hell I still have faith
To one day be free with my Father at the Gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on Earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life, you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils trying to stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clocking
I'm tick-tocking, once I start, I ain't stopping
Such bullshit that my soul deal with
When my room's dim lit, I pray to God to help with, uh
My endeavors, in any kind of weather
Hoes be pleather-fake, so I erase 'em out my sim
Now do you wanna be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide tryna read my mind
Now do you wanna be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide tryna read my mind
Down and out
Hey, down and out, out
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in

Down and out
Down and out
Down and out
Down and out
Yeah, yeah
Okay, okay
