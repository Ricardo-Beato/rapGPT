What it do nephew
This is big Snoop Dogg
Hanging out my nigga, my nerve, DJ Drama in the motherfucking house
For the two-thousand plus, three times two, plus one
Add that shit up nigga
My nigga $hort Dog in the house
My nigga will.i.am in the house
Suh— Snoop Dogg's in the house
We— We— West coast make 'em bounce, bounce
It makes me wanna bounce
It makes me wanna bounce
It makes me wanna bounce
It makes me wanna bounce
DJ Skee

Get loose, get wild, now get set
Yeah, it's the anthem, nigga, it's the shit
You can get crunk, get hyphy, get fit
You can bounce like you're hoppin' over a motherfuckin' fence
If you in the whip, ghostride the bitch
Slip into the liquor sto' sippin' on a fifth
Yeah, nigga, bring in the bag
Gangbang on you motherfuckers claimin' the flag
West coast, nigga, I'm a real go-getter
Forty ounce sipper, the black Jack Tripper (Dramatic)
20 Cripper, 10-to-1 I flip her
Got the hook-up on the birds and the motherfuckin' zippers
Go to the club with my thugs, sell drugs
And I might get a girl but I ain't gon' tip her
Get mo' liquor, spit mo' slicker
Put your hands in the air, motherfucker, it's a stick up
Nah, nigga, eat a dick up
You say you a pimp, but you in love with a stripper
Just bounce to the beat and don't pay me no attention
Just bounce to the beat, bounce, bounce to the beat
You might also like
Snoop Dogg's in the house
The nigga Too $hort's in the house
Put Will.i.am's in the house
W-west coast, make em bounceEmbed
