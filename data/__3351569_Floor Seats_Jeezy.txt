20 ContributorsFloor Seats Lyrics
She be on it (yo know what this shit is)
She be on it
She be on it
She be on it

She know that paper good, know that paper good
Might blow a few dollars, boy, that's on the hood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood
They know that paper good, know that paper good
Pull up in that Wraith, them bitches on the wood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood

Real bitch, all she fuck is real nigga
Rich bitch, all she want is real figures
Bitch, hustle all day, she got a good job
But I don't trust her late, brother he a straight rob
Type of young nigga, kick a nigga jaw
You know I hop about that Wraith, take a nigga hoe
Yea, shit I'm ridin' in, got stars in it
All black Louis bag, Audemars in it
Fiji Water, yea we call it slip a slide
Six Flags, babe, I'm tryna ride the ride
Boss bitch, baby daddy in the feds
Say these niggas 'bout they feeling but she 'bout her bread
You might also like
She know that paper good, know that paper good
Might blow a few dollars, boy, that's on the hood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood
They know that paper good, know that paper good
Pull up in that Wraith, them bitches on the wood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood

You ain't gettin' money? Sorry for your mishaps
WNBA, you 'bout to get bitch slapped
Fuck the "Kissing Cam", they need to have "Shoe Cam"
Last game, the shoes I had on cost 2 grand
Ya know who winnin', yea, you can check the scoreboard
Fly like a Concorde, shades are the Tom Ford
Ass shakin' on court, diamonds sayin' "Bonjour"
You don't really want war, end up at ya front door!
Boy! Ya last if you ain't in first place
I think you in my parking spot, that's the first place
Worse case scenario, I want some camel toe
And in a fruit fight, I'll bust ya cantaloupe

She know that paper good, know that paper good
Might blow a few dollars, boy, that's on the hood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood
They know that paper good, know that paper good
Pull up in that Wraith, them bitches on the wood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood
Got her courtside on the big screen
And I ain't in the coupe, I'm in the big thing
Ain't nothing like your hoe, she a fuckin' star
Ain't never been shy, she suck it in the car
She know I stayed down 'til I was papered up
Send them units outta town, I had to tape 'em up
And when we pulled up, that's when it popped off
Keep talkin' like that, I'll get you knocked off
Twenty-six-fives, what the ducks cost?
Got a condo in the city, that's a duck-off
See my partna ridin' with me, he the trigger man
Say your name, yo nigga like I'm Jigga man

She know that paper good, know that paper good
Might blow a few dollars, boy, that's on the hood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood
They know that paper good, know that paper good
Pull up in that Wraith, them bitches on the wood
Let's get it understood
Hawk game, floor seats, yeah she on the wood

She be on it
She be on it
Woah, She be on itEmbed
