Hit 'em with the jab
Buddah Bless this beat

Love me today, love me forever
Ride with me, bae, ridin' forever
Love me today, love me forever
Love me today, love me today
Love me today, love me forever
Ride with me, bae, ridin' forever
Love me today, love me today
Will you love me today? And love me forever

(Lil Boat)
What type of time you want? (Oh)
Make you fall in love by the time you gone
Ain't tryna play wit you, baby, I'm too grown (Grown)
Gettin' too much guap (Guap), put diamonds in your watch (Watch)
Baby girl, you look good in that halter top
Drop the top on the coupe and do donuts in the lot
Hold it down for me (Yeah)
Baby, watch my back, these niggas plottin' on me (Yeah)
Both of us are bosses, that's why you ride with me

Love me today, love me forever
Ride with me, bae, ridin' forever
Love me today, love me forever
Love me today, love me today
Love me today, love me forever
Ride with me, bae, ridin' forever
Love me today, love me today
Will you love me today? And love me forever4Embed
