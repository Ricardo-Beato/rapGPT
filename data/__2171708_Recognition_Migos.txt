25 ContributorsRecognition Lyrics
You know it feel good when your recognized
Recognized (Recognized, Recognized)
I just wanted to be
I didn't know all this was gonna come with it

I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition (Recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be recognized  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition

I just want to be recognized
Make my momma smile
Make my grand momma proud
Now I got recognition
Same people doubted see me on television (TV)
Pocket watching on a nigga cheque
Recognize a nigga Rolex
17 years old nigga kicking doors
Couldn't even vote yet
Meditation of the mind was the greatest thing a nigga found
They recognize a nigga sound
And we didn't let the world down
Started with a brick turned it to a foundation
Turn the foundation to an empire
I'm the founder of Yung Rich Nation
And I still get recognized by my old patients
With a snaggle tooth smile, he said he happy that I made it
You might also like
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be recognized (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition

If I got the feeling that I weren't recognized
I know I'd still be recognized in momma's eyes
I'm in the trench coat for the skies
I keep the .45 on my waistline
Shoot your block down with the Glock like a alpine
Fuck it shoot the club up call me Shyne
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
That Migos on the billboard worldwide we recognized
A lot of these niggas wanna be recognized
But get caught jammed up not gonna do the time
I know some niggas they got acquitted
And they didn't want tell and get crucified
I'm smoking on OG, it ease my mind
Need some Visine cause I got the red eyes
Ain't thinking 'bout a bitch I'm getting money cause these bitches come and go like red eyes
Now I'm recognized taking trips in my lamb I own it no enterprise
Looking at niggas can't be mad at niggas cause nigga just want to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be recognized  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition

Momma said recognize God
I recognized then my momma had pain in her eyes
So I walked through the shadow, the valley of death
I'm addicted to drank and I can't even help it (lean, lean, drank, drank)
Pussy nigga taking selfies
Ask me for money I told that nigga no he go round the hood saying I'm selfish (huh?)
That's the reason that I left him
Your momma keep calling say help
She didn't recognized you was a failure
I wanted to be recognized
Went to the mall and bought me a 10 and told the school it caught me five
My OG taught me to be wise
Thanking the lord cause I'm recognized
VH1 you can go see it live
Now you see me shining now you want to ride (Skrrr)
They finally recognized
They copy the way we rhyme
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (Recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be Recognized  (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition4Embed
