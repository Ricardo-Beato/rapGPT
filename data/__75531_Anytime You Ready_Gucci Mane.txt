24 ContributorsAnytime You Ready Lyrics
Well, it take money to make money
That's why I make money
Need some today so
I'mma go take they money
Flip money, I weigh money
Hundred grand, that's play money
Counterfeit, that's fake money
Lob city, that's Blake money
Cash money, that's Drake money
Broke niggas, they hate money
Rappers they get slave money
Gucci Mane, I save money
Gamble in your face money
Brick squad we taste money
Gold diggers they chase money
Rich niggas we waste money!
Street smart, I know money
Y'all niggas got no money
Still making that slow money
Ha, cause you owe money
Pimp niggas get ho money
Scared money don't make money
Like Big Meech, I blow money
Y'all niggas is so funny
You might also like
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x3

Got money I said it
Brick Squad we ain't petty
I'm so big headed, hundred eighty grand on my Chevy
Go broke, won't let it
Swag sick can't help it
Financial goals I met it
It's a drummer track an it's epic
I'm a hood nigga with credit
Bills, I don't sweat it
Cash I go get it
But these broke niggas pathetic
Rich niggas go get it
Bitch niggas get jealous
Drop money, I'm careless
It's all mine, I'm selfish
Your money home, you left it
Broke nigga can't help it
Ball hard, I'm wealthy
Thank God I'm healthy
From the jet way to the jet-ski
Aren't you glad you met me?
Haters said they don't like me
But they gotta respect me!
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x3

G nigga, about paper
Them niggas getting the vapor
We the niggas flipping that money
And them other niggas be fakers
High roller we shot callin'
Real nigga we been ballin'
Pussy nigga catch a sideline and
Watching niggas who both balling
Hustle nigga my own line
Pussy niggas get flat-line
Money nigga, get all the time
New whip, for the sunshine
Hustle with my balling nigga
Cooking up them quarter, niggas
Stepping up them order niggas
Getting it out that water nigga
Rich game, my rich gang nigga
Feline and my wrist game nigga
Weed niggas getting rich game
We the niggas flipping the wrist game
Key nigga, we move blood
Get it from the G blood
Uptown, we feed bloods
Feed a nigga a dope plug
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x32Embed
