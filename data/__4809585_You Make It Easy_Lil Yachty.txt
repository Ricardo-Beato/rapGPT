9 ContributorsYou Make It Easy Lyrics
Smile, smile for me
Your eyes, bright as the skies for a million miles
Your face, taking me to outer space
Kissing you in every place
Baby girl, loving you shouldn't be a race
On a pedestal like a trophy case
You're so special to me
Meet my mommy, make it official, meet my mommy
I know it's too early to tell but I think this for real
I can feel it, it's for real, so for real, yeah, and I-
Yeah, I don't know what's next
Yeah, I don't know what's next, for us
I don't know what's best
Time we must invest, to grow
Lovin' everything you do
Took us long enough, took you long enough to see me
Lovin' you, everything you do, you make it easyYou might also likeEmbed
