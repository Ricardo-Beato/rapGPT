Stone-cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
Murder, murder, ha
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)
Murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!)
Bullet to the dome, to the head
Murda dem down, kill a yout'
Don fi pull up on di man and
(Turn me up!) What it look like?
See, murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!)
Bullets come down from the air
Murda dem down, kill a yout'
Don fi pull up on di man and
(Turn me up!) What it look?
There's the stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
It's murder, it's murder
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)
It's been a 187 in this bitch!
You might also like
Murder this, murder listen, hear that Suburban whippin'?
Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!)
And I bet you miss her
Reload the Pro Tools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand
Scottie Pippen, both ways
Been doin' drive-bys
Got this music industry timeline lookin' like Rosecrans
When these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talking about that bottom, where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (Thighs high)
Sometimes, I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed something to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic
There's the stone-cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
It's murder, it's murder
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)
(Ahh, shit!) Recognize what live inside these eyes
I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
I say "Fuck is up?" I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up, and something's up
I hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life, fuck your hope
Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton, homie!

Murder, murder
Murder... murder
It's all murder... murder
Ahh!
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
It's been a 187 in this bitch!31Embed
