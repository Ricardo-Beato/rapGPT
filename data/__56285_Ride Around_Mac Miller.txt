31 ContributorsRide Around Lyrics
Ridin' with the window down, rollin' through the city
Got the weed goin' 'round and the Most Dope with me, hey
Simply gettin' high like it's 1969
I'ma be grindin' 'til the kid a-hundred-sixty
New York, Atlanta too, flyer than Santa's shoes
She bring her camera through, I'm playin' Crash Bandicoot
This be the bitch, got some cock to serve her
I'ma rape the game, no Roethlisberger, hey
Above the clouds, seein' stars like L.A.
Have your girl always comin' back like Elway
I'ma be rich, that's what they tell me
So let me start workin' with this paper like an essay, hey
Athleticism, workin' game when I'm gettin' women
The freshest linen, like I'm spittin' through your television
In a daydream, livin' while these minutes pass me by
Lean back and hang these Nikes out the ride, just

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road
You might also like
Rockin' khaki colored jeans and a plain white tee
Nike watch, POW! chain, spend a day like me, hey
Every day like a movie scene
Smokin' weed, eyes glued to the computer screen
I'm super duper skeed, ridin' in the Civic
Just got some speakers, now I'm tryin' get it tinted
Every dream vivid, talk it how I live it
Uh, up in the air playin' Quidditch, bitches
This is once in a lifetime
They gon' put me in a flight, no Priceline
Used to want to be in Marvel, fightin' crimes
'Til I realized the boy had the nicest rhymes

Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road
Roll the windows down, turn the system up
We just tryna ride around, 'cause we don't give a fuck
Got a full tank of gas and some shit to smoke
Hey, let's just hit the road3Embed
