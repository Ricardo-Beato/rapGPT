10 ContributorsOut Da Mudd Lyrics
2 cups in the bitch
Got it out the mud
Freeband Gang

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS wrapped around the Breitling with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

LeBron on the front, Kobe on the back
I’m the astronaut kid money way taller than Shaq
Before on rap on the track, got her standing on the track
Nigga Cocaine mafia, jumping off packs
Forgiato with the skinny tires, they lookin’ flat
I see you looking real goony eyed
I’m lookin’ back, I be running through the pack to DMV
Used to catch the flight to AZ with fake ID
They ain’t never gonna  that got my nigga killed
Represent for the game cause thats how a niggas built
Go and spend a 5th at Fifths, run it up and take a trip
Leaning off four zips, riding in a spaceship
You might also like
Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud

I got it out the money, that nasty ass money
Brown paper bag ole dope boy money
Foreign with the frog eyes, Bentley with the big head
Fast lane with no hands, counting money with both hands
On the road with checks like a motherfuckin’ mailman
Started from hundred, no-one gave me shit
I jugged off bricks, Got rich off bricks
Forgiatos on that jag I cashed out off a lick
So many bands in my pocket make me walk with a limp
Full of dirty ? Valet at Fifths
Finesse I got Freebandz to get
Black amigo, who live life like this

Forgiatos standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Yo Campaign hot it rolling, you ain’t made a real jugg
Ain’t no way that money folded
Got myself hot these hoes in VIP patrollin’
Boogers in my ears around my watch and they loaded
Solitary clips, I’m in the studio devoted
If you knew what it took to get here you could understand my flowin’
Doja, I Hit the dope my words come out folded
Turn the lights our, I’m going inside the mic raw
More Diesel than a 18-Wheeler, I’m with them killers
Forgiato’s on the coupe creeping like a caterpillar
Got the money in the Louis bag, right by to the pistol
Long as the money come, you know I’m gone deliver

Forgiato’s standing the coupe look bowlegged
VVS rapped around the Breathing with the big head
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mud
Just the other day spent 25 in Neiman’s
$200k I just make that shit this evening
I Got it out the mud, I Got it out the mudEmbed
