5 ContributorsReverend Do Good #2 LyricsMmm, I fell in love
We're feeling good
Make you wanna do good
Now ask me
Do you want to look good?
Whether wearing your Sean Johns
Or your Ruff Ryder
Giddy up for Jesus!
Giddy up for Jesus!
Jesus is everywhere
In the church, you see Jesus
When you go to sleep, you dream Jesus
When you wake up, you see Jesus
When you put your toast in the toaster, who pop up? *ding* Jesus! (Jesus!)
When you take your clothes out the dryer, who do you see? (Jesus!) Jesus!
I looked in my closest and guess who I saw (Jesus!)
No! But when I turned around, he was right behind me!
He was right behind me! He was right behind me!You might also likeEmbed
