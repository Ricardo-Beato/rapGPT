39 ContributorsWhat Dreams Are Made Of Lyrics
“It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You’re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!”

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I’m what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that’s Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on ‘em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I’m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
You might also like
Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I’m still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yamaka
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of5Embed
