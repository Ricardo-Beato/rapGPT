54 ContributorsGirls, Girls, Girls (Part 2) Lyrics
I'm not a one girl's guy (Real talk for you, peep game)
And they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie (We don't lie, man)
And the girls respect me for it (You gotta respect that)
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (I mean, never say never)
But right now, it's just too many fine ladies out there (Too many ladies, hah)
To choose one from
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour (Woo)

Who you lovin'? Who you wanna be huggin', huh?
Who you with? Who you wanna be fuckin'?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's terms, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in-house tutorin'
In and out, I'm movin' through her student body union
And she call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, "At this rate, ma, you'll never graduate"
She said, "I ain't no fool, I'll make it up in summer school"
You might also like
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin' girls out (Just tryin' girls out)
Just tryin' girls out
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

Huh? Who you lovin'? Who you wanna be fuckin'?
Who said what? Why you trippin', girl? Why is you fussin'?
Got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
Spend her whole day, she hanging 'round with part-time haters
All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries, in ten places at once (Woo)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
And some day, I'll slow down, but for now, I get around
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty-inches
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
You tell 'em chicks if they must know my business
I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louis, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party, but come home early
Light, kinda dark, short, sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook-up on the license
But she can get you first-class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds

I'm tryin' girls out
Just tryin' girls out
Put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I get off tour
I'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie
And the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened
But right now, it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from
I'm tryin' girls out (Waitin' patiently)
Just tryin' girls out (Until I find the one for me)10Embed
