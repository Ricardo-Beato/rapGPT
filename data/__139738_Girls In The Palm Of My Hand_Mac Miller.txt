12 ContributorsGirls In The Palm Of My Hand Lyrics
Better mix this right motherfucker, haha
Yeah, that's right, y'all
Let's get it
Haha
(DJ CapCom)
Haha
(You know these girls, yo?)
(Let me get in this real quick, yo)
(Take this out) Let's get it
Let's get it
Uh

I got girls in the palm of my hand (Aha)
And they all wanna call me they man (Uh-huh)
But I'm out for the dough, hoes piff
Girls on my dick like a pogo stick (Pogo stick)
Go up and down, up and down (Ha)
Now let me see you drop low and touch the ground
So who wanna fuck me now? (Aha)
I know you heard that I'm fuckin' around
Listen, numbnuts, fuckin' with them young sluts
Bust nuts on they mouth and they guts (Guts)
Get dome in the back of the bus
I ain't askin' to touch, just pass me the Dutch
Smoke a L while I'm gettin' my cutty (Cutty)
Hit a ho, put my dick in her tummy (Aha)
For the money chips like Nestl√©, text me
Every single day for the next week
Hoes won't leave me alone (Nuh-uh)
Just bone and I'm leavin' her home (Ha)
East to her own, no teeth with the dome
Girls always wanna try and creep on my phone
Don't rest, never will the sex end
Next night, I'll be hittin' up her best friend (Aha)
First impression got her undressin' (Yeah)
Sextin', sextin', sextin', sextin' (Yeah)
You come like a Smith & Wesson (Haha)
Nausea, heartburn, indigestion (Yeah)
No question, damn, I'm free
Fuck every female on your family tree
Uh, can't stop crushin', since the sandbox
Get a handjob from your grandma
Ha! Are you down for the truth?
I'm gettin' brains right now in the booth
After this jam, drop her off at her house
But now she's busy with my balls in her mouth (Haha)
Ha, go and talk to me now
Psych, keep your lips on my cock for a while (Aha)
That's degradin', I'm not hatin' (No)
This music for baby-makin' (Yup)
Spittin' rap in the sack, bitches with their titties flashed
Sick as that, gettin' that strap with the Jimmy hat (Oh)
I don't want no H.I.V. (I.V.)
Easy Mac, girl, taste my cheese
Stay rubbin', no bustin'
Pussy stay flooded, end of discussion
Look good, had to put her in a thong
Sex so crazy had to put it in a song (Aha)
All night long, got it on
In the morning, gotta drop her at her mom's
You might also like
(Haha) Young-ass ho, yeah
Easy Mac, The Class Clown, motherfuckers (That's what it is)
Droppin' soon (That's all y'all hoes)
East End Empire (I know y'all know my number)
 been blowin' me the fuck up
(Aha) You stank-ass bitches, ha
Ayy, ayyEmbed
