17 ContributorsGucci Land Lyrics
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci just gave me M's, haha
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci (Yeah, no cap, Wop)

Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

Yeah, it's hard, but it's fair, but it's tough on a square
You know salt kill snails, not players
Sell water to a whale, put a whale on a scale
When the hammer hit the motherfuckin' nail
Send a bale in the mail, fuck the judge and the jury
And the jail and the motherfuckin' cell
Know Chanel and it's Gucci, you can tell
You can smell, I'm a player, pull up in a V12
I wear Gucci all the time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'
This exclusive, can't get it online
Shawty party all the time, and she fine, dead fine
And the bills, she don't pay 'em no mind
Tailormade, I don't do the cleaners no more
Light billi', I don't really spend M's no more
Stadiums, I don't do arenas no more
Fuck handcuffs, I don't wanna see 'em no more
Italian stallion, Rocky Balboa
Plug with the cord tryna sell a motherload
Whip it off the stove, gotta use another bowl
Swerve past a hater like a hole in the road
Link with the gang, don't sell your soul
Freeze my crew, I'm subzero
Fish in the dish, tryna find Nemo
Took a nine and a half, made a whole kilo
Fur like it's winter still, rain on the windowsill
Summertime drop-top, fresher than a summer hill
Candlerville, run the town, pull up where your mama live
Opp in every hood say I'm not really wanted here
Diamonds in my right ear, diamonds in my wife ear
Future say life good, yeah, it's really nice here
Niggas I don't like here, niggas wanna fight here
Touch you me, zap you with the fire, Buzz Lightyear

Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

I done spent a couple mil' on clothes and another half a mil' on her toes and her sandals (Toes)
She was suckin' my dick behind her old man back, now that's what you call a scandal (Ah)
She like to gangbang, like the way I throw it up, now she wanna fuck a red bandana (Yeah)
Young nigga gettin' freaky with these hoes, let 'em rub my back with a goddamn candle (Swear)
Peep out the way they be glist' on the wrist, I can put this shit on without tryin' (No cap)
Look at the twinkle and glisten, it's no pretty penny, it cost me a dime (Dime)
Pimpin' 'em early, these bitches is dirty, they fuck on your mans all the time (Shit)
Too hard to snooze and lose, I'm slimy, I'm sneakin' this shit every time (Yeah)
I hit more bitches than Rocky Balboa
Black diamonds on me, they came out the sewer
She call me Prince and I'm fuckin' her raw
I know that I save her, she call me the Lord
I'm rockin' Dior and it ain't in the store
I sleep in the coupe and I'm rich as a whore
Look at my cars and play eeny-miny-moe (Pick one)
Bullets in the clip, and they long as your toe (Grrt, grrt)
Give her five racks and she suck 'til it's sore
Iguodala diamonds big as your toe
Cuban link on me thick as a rope
You told and you broke, you a rat and a roach
She not a squirter, but that pussy soaked
Mmm, it felt like we fucked on a boat
Mmm, my dick ain't no weed, but she choke
Mmm, bought her five-thousand-dollar soap
Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, GucciEmbed
