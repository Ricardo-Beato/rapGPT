99 ContributorsGo to Sleep Lyrics
*yaaaawn*
Thank you
Feels good waking up! Get back...
On my J-O...
*yaaaawn*
I'll be going...
Plus, I gotta go to work
It's cool!

I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica; coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon, might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they can’t see me, I took out their eyes
Replace with some he’s, so all they see is eh’s
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl, let’s see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words, and you can rest in peace
I’m the hook after your last verse I’m also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep
You might also like
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

Insomniac since way back, see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don’t need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm: mental state is Zen-like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine, yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin’ on the flo', fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still won’t blow my candle out
My "can do" spirit's in the house
And is possessing your possessions, did you hear it by the couch?
Boogieman under your bed, not in your closet
Cause I'm not a homo, won't drill no door hole
I won’t make a peep, so you can go to sleep
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry, but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer, you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans don’t fly
The boy in the balloon - see? I didn’t go hide
And I'm coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to O-P-EN
They said they need a hero in it so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old-school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him; woke the roosters, woke the hens
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that you…
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off
If talk is cheap, then my silence is diamonds. Preach15Embed
