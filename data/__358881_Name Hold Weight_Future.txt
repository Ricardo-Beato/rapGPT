10 ContributorsName Hold Weight Lyrics
You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
It's ain't hard to see my name hold weight
My name hold weight
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
Cause my name hold weight
My name hold weight

Feel like I've been here forever
I came in with gun powder on my beather
Already knew you wasn't on my level from yo schedule
Before I settle I chased that cheddar
I wake up every day tryin to better myself and all my fellas
Don't never file out bout no bitch, she ain't that special
And it ain't all bout glame and glisten cause I'm a treasure
I build my name from con to bricks I can change the weather
It was cloudy around my way I gride hard and never settle
Say when it rains it pours and now its bottles galore
I have done counted so much cans that my hands are sore
We went from rags to riches, two thousands pounds of midget
We got ARs everywhere them hundred round biscuits
You might also like
You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
It's ain't hard to see my name hold weight
My name hold weight
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
Cause my name hold weight
My name hold weight

I'm sleeping on Grandma floor nigga
With my blow nigga
I had to say fuck my ho nigga and the rest of these hoes nigga
I'm TTGG train to go get it
Freebands I'm too committed I cap a A 1 vision
Ain't always made the best decisions
But ion saving no pigeons imma turn it up a notch for my team
Gallon of drink when we lean we got ice we got cream
We got a couple girl freaks that you've seen in magazines
Covered all the ground work with from working off the beam
You be salute to the hood of Mexico and that's king
And I'm balling like Kaarem but the game ain't what it seem
I got to go hard by all means
I go berserk by all means
Fuck you lames fuck the fame cause I'm living out my dream
You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
It's ain't hard to see my name hold weight
My name hold weight
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
Cause my name hold weight
My name hold weight1Embed
