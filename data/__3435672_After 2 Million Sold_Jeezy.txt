3 ContributorsAfter 2 Million Sold Lyrics2 million records sold, you still worried bout Jay?
Just as I suspected, you niggas is gay!
Puss ass niggas, yeah y'all strictly dickly
You want me that bad, muhfucka come get me
I can promise you this, it won't be easy
If I'on lick the whole clip, then I won't be Jeezy
I sold rocks for a pair of Air Jordans
But I still flip blocks for that Jordan money
Snowman, the young Lebrons of the game
But still a O.G. like Charles
Run D on these niggas like it's no tomorrow
I don't freestyle, but I style for free
You ain't never meet a young nigga as wild as me
Say den boy lick shots, somebody call the doctor
Got the AR sounding like a helicopter
Fire up a blunt while I switch up the clips
Rules of engagement, real boss shit
Fire, even if you ain't fired upon
Back down from no nigga
Silverback gorilla
It's a jungle out there
White bricks, oh my
As long as the money come, imma stay fly
Make em go crazy like the remix did
Or hypnotize they minds, like Three 6 did
