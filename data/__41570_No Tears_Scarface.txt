43 ContributorsNo Tears Lyrics
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut gettin' fired up
Lookin' for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfuckin' killer
I want you to witness your motherfuckin' murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
'Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin' through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life's in danger (By a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wantin' to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holloway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin' up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch (Quick)
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm lookin' at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lick shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
'Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it, uh
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga (You fuckin' with the very best)
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm goin' off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleepin'
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this motherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fuckin' grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die, they'll be no tears in the end
