Pronto, Pronto, Pronto
Pronto, Pronto, Pronto
ASAP, ASAP, Pronto

ASAP, ASAP, Pronto, Yeah, Yeah

Fucking with the money pronto, need my cash on time pronto
Tell the plug pull up pronto, ASAP, right now, pronto

Need the cash on time, pronto, tell the plug pull up pronto
Pronto, right now, ASAP, pronto
Pronto, pronto

Hold up wait, need the cash pronto
Quavo, Call up plug he in Tokyo
Place your order, need a bird pronto
I got that Juliet ain't talking Romeo
All my goons we wild boys ain't talking bout Steve-O
All the hoes they bad, cause this money on the floor
They wanna go, pronto
Tell her to put the molly on her tongue and nose
Lets ride
Yeah we going to Northside
Migo gang till I die
Fuck 12, the FBI

Fucking with the money pronto, need my cash on time pronto
Tell the plug pull up pronto, ASAP, right now, pronto
Pronto, pronto
Need the cash on time, pronto, tell the plug pull up pronto
Pronto, right now, ASAP, pronto
Pronto, pronto

Started from a brick now I'm in a condo
Happen so fast, ASAP, Pronto
Ain't really worried bout shit no more
Running to the money like Usain Bolt
Sipping on the lean, Now I'm in slow-mo
Meeting wit the plug just to get the pesos
Can't even wait, gotta go in get the the cake
Cause momma told me to put the food on the plate
No delay, I need it andal√©
Gone just pay for the goons start to spray
Ain't really trying take the shit that far
Smoking on the gas that nigga on Mars
Hurricane wrist got a nigga sea sick
Paid in Full but my name ain't Mitch
And the trap got gas, and the trap got brick
ASAP, Pronto, man a nigga got rich
Fucking with the money pronto, need my cash on time pronto
Tell the plug pull up pronto, ASAP, right now, pronto
Pronto, pronto
Need the cash on time, pronto, tell the plug pull up pronto
Pronto, right now, ASAP, pronto
Pronto, pronto

I'm going in, no needles
I got stripes, no Adidas
I got juice, no beetles
Bells in the trunk, fuck carrying a visa
My Spanish plug Eduardo, his cousin El Chapo
They keep that coco
If I need that 2 doe, I call up Pedro
Barbados where I get that yayo
Say you need that pronto, I'mma call El Sancho
Free big bruh West side, The OG the head honcho
Tell the judge, ASAP, right now, Like pronto
Trapping out the bando
Moved up to the condo, to the mansion, to the penthouse
Ain't got nowhere to trap no more
Plugged in with Obama, trapping out of the White House
Riding with J Tony
Guaranteed to knock lights out
Fucking with the money pronto, need my cash on time pronto
Tell the plug pull up pronto, ASAP, right now, pronto
Pronto, pronto
Need the cash on time, pronto, tell the plug pull up pronto
Pronto, right now, ASAP, pronto
Pronto, pronto3Embed
