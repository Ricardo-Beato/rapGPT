When I do this shit, don't I make this shit look easy?
I be killing beats, it’s a monster in my feature
Don't sit on my floor seats, sharper than a nedal
I be higher than Osama, smoking on that og reefer
I kill my apoanant, there is no one in my 
You ain't gotta tell me, cause I know who 
Believe when I ame, my target I ain’t missing

Watch how I 
You won't help , 
In a new Coope, 
I spit bitch, like I just lost a tooth
You acting tough like your ride bullet proof
Still cross this line, you will get chewed
I'm a beast off the leash, move
And I ride the beat like a fucking 
You can keep that shit you want to
Switching to a pussy when a nigga right in front of you
I smoke like a blunt 
Got ashes on your whole damb coope

When I do this shit, don't I make this shit look easy?
I be killing beats, it's a monster in my feature
Don't sit on my floor seats, sharper than a nedal
I be higher than Osama, smoking on that og reefer
I kill my apoanant, there is no one in my 
You ain't gotta tell me, cause I know who 
Believe when I ame, my target I ain't missing

I put it together like I’m 
Got a young nigga who'll off you for some

Money right there 
I’m in love with the snare

I'm in love with the white, but I'm not a racest
I drink my drinks straight no chacer

When I do this shit, don’t I make this shit look easy?
I be killing beats, it's a monster in my feature
Don't sit on my floor seats, sharper than a nedal
I be higher than Osama, smoking on that og reefer

You ain't gotta tell me, cause I know who 
Believe when I ame, my target I ain't missing

 if it ain't about counting
And I give 2 fucks about your mug frowning
And it ain't my falt that you and money ain't combining
You're worser than a credit card that keep on declining
 gotta blam it
You ain't the only one screaming you got problems
You ain't the only one that's got niggas that's riding
If I could take your head off, and I 
MPA, we mugging, top shottas
We come for everything, please give me the dolla
Take the weed and the money, 

When I do this shit, don't I make this shit look easy?
I be killing beats, it's a monster in my feature
Don't sit on my floor seats, sharper than a nedal
I be higher than Osama, smoking on that og reefer
I kill my apoanant, there is no one in my 
You ain't gotta tell me, cause I know who 
Believe when I ame, my target I ain't missingEmbed
