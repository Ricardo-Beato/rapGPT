6 ContributorsNiggas Is Up To No Good Lyrics
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how I love the slaughter
Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough kis from the Cubans, to build a fuckin fort
I'm caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, that's swole
Catching bodies like a cold, and I stay sick, so face it
You make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fucking streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I love money, but the scramblings hot
So I snatch up my man and hit gambling spot
Twenty grand is got, one nigga shot, that's one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fucking vest

I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

I'm fed up with the bullshit, so now I'm giving
Slugs to other thugs who don't know how the fuck I'm livin'
I'm wondering, what the fuck you eye-in me for
When you know that D for, blowing shit up like C4
B-More to New York, I stalk, left an assailant
Under stress cause ATF keeps me under surveillance
I got a lot of hatred up in me and they've been wanting
To send me to the penitentiary, to knock out a 10 to 20
For the many lives I've destroyed and such
Ways that'll make the days of Freddy seem like a touch
Is it much asking to be left alone not to be bothered
Got bitches on my dick like I'm their baby's father
Bring back like Pearl Harbor, blowing up shit
And big fat shoutout to all the bitches that suck dick
I must get, my dirt done, before the daylight
Make sure my flow stays tight, you fucking A-right
You might also like
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

Niggas be like "Ill" when I wreck, cause I don't go fair
Bitches be like "Man he ain't even have to go there"
Whether I get your ass with the body blows
Or hit you with the shotty holes
Your fuckin' crew is running like a snotty nose
I ain't a killer but I'll kill something
And if a nigga holding something, I'm a steal something
I'll peel something back like a nigga's cap, leave him stinking
Put a hole in his head, and find out what he was thinking
Niggas who don't know the half
I show the wrath of a savage and do bodily damage
To a motherfucker's cabbage
Money had a lot of mouth but as soon as he seen me
His bitchass copped out to a mister-I-didn't-mean-it
Niggas fiend it cause they want it, but don't get it
Cause they sweat it, to fucking hard and let it
Take over shit, dead it now set it
Full breaded like a pit that scratches first, hittin fast
How many motherfucking times must I put foot up in your ass
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!Embed
