44 ContributorsThe Projects Lyrics
Peace, God (Peace to the gods)
How you, God? (Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)

The Fuck? It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli, kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open, push your seat back, just flow
That's how we doing it

Bound by honor, sword take over the set
Rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the TEC, crash your intellect, select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo, every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's Whitewater Scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo, mad support, drink a quart then vamp
One nasty can blew
My pen sterile, won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down, play the anthem
Lit it, who with it? Champagne get it, that's the ticket
Silent nines sounding like crickets, snatch your workerâ€™s shipment
Pull her hair, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who ripped it?

Projects (My niggas survive, just like a moving target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage, that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large, yo, stop miraging)

Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is TEC-9
Blast at any close encounter of the third kind
This be the evil that man do, we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle my flurry
Hear me, you jam on, you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure, red hot like chilli pepper
Black 'n Decker hardware, avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark the secret agent
That macks well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to the killing fields with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes

Projects (My niggas survive, just like a moving target)
Projects (Where niggas live and some sell garbage, that's)
Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects (I'm living large yo, stop miraging)
Suck my dick, it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face, plus it come in globs
Quick, get on your knees
With your sweet pussy, let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spreaded and shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world the womb
Titties sagging, stomach on some shriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy
You screaming that it's talking to you, daddy
Fart's breathing out your lips, splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a Great Adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remy on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbing my shit, you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy lead to friction burns, plus beef I hone
The condom broke
Bitch, you got AIDS, I'm shaking in my bones4Embed
