Pipe up this bitch (p-p-pipe)
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch (pipe it up)
Think it's dark in this bitch (dark)
Don’t worry cause I got some light on my wrist (ice)
Want to talk about dab
The difference between us and them, we created that shit (dab)
Stackin’ money ever since
If it ain’t about money it don’t make sense (uh uh)
Dope in the coupe and it’s two percent tint (woah)
Dope in her coochie, I'm pimping this bitch (bitch)
Keep it a hundred, I’m sick of this bitch (bah)
Never ate breakfast but eat up the grits (uh-huh)
Hold everything but she can’t get the stick (grah)
Taking a charge, I’ma give her the dick (uh-uh)
Chew it up, eat it up like it’s a Twix (arr)
Most of these niggas nowadays counterfeit (flex)
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I’ma have to charge you at ten (ten)
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Fell asleep on drank at the house party with Diddy (nah real)
Who the fuck said we ain’t plugged in the city
Never mind, niggas done turned into crickets (Takeoff)

I see a hundred cameras (hoo), doing shows in Alabama (flash)
I’m not your average rapper (nah)
Come to my trap, I’ll tax ya (tax ya)
My diamonds came from Africa (shine), like Michael Blackson (Blackson)
I spent 10k in Magic (10k), two bitches fucked my fashion (Magic)
They think because I’m rapping (huh), Houdini won’t do magic (Houdini)
Working the water in Atlantic (water)
Money stretched out to Kansas (stretch it)
Big body panoramic (big body)

(Offset!)
Look at my diamonds, they wink and say peek-a-boo (peek-a-boo)
I shock the block like I’m Pikachu (shock the block)
I shot the Glock, tried to kill a few (shot the Glock)
I put that dope in her dookie chute (dope)
We fuck these bitches, we switch-a-roo (switch-a-roo)
I had to beat it like Michael do (beat it)
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce (mud)
I create flames when I’m in the booth (uh)
Wide (wide), body (body), I’m bout to buy me an island (island)
Dab (dab), stylish (style), these not on the shelf, you can’t find ‘em (nah)
Ice (ice), blind ‘em (bluh), if I’m eyeing it told you I’m buying it (buyin' it)
We together, we never divided (divided)
Like a feather I’m flier than pilots (a pilot)
Chew my dab up just like it is Trident (arr)
Kept it real with you niggas, we tried it (tried it)
Got to hit hard and move silent (uh)
If it’s bout the money then I’m riding (ayy)
If you broke, need a job, I can hire you (hire you)
Offset, your dab is expiring (expiring)
Your pockets ain’t straight, need alignment (alignment)
The bando is my type environment (bando)7Embed
