This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six-month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
'Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seein' summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seein' summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
'Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav'
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"

And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down (With my windows down)
You might also like
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a mill, tell 'em that
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you talkin' 'bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

Uh, this is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller?
But I'ma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on
And I just want to roll with my windows down, yeah
And I just want to roll with my windows down, yeah, oh, ooh, ha21Embed
