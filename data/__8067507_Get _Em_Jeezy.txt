1 ContributorGet â€™Em Lyrics
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em

I need a doctor, I got a sick wrist game
Hit the blunt twice, then I switch lanes
I'm ridin' on some grown men
What you wanna play, let the games begin
On the count of three, here we go
And i don't talk fast, ya'll just listen slow
They need glasses, they ain't seein' me
Stevie Wonder, ass n* ain't seein' me
Four X, white tee and a wife beata
Got my Desert Eagle, call it senorita
Got a way with words, paint a picture man
And, I don't smoke Phillies, I'm a swisher man
You might also like
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em

Catch me in Walter's, spendin' grands, man
When I leave they got to help me tote my bags, man
Jeezy poppin' tags, you better make way
Drought a vouch for me, ask Kumate
And I don't think they heard me
Ain't no n*  in the league got more jerseys
No matter the price
I can wear one every day for the rest of my life
I ain't gon' lie, I got a lot of paper
So when I'm out shinin', I see a lot of hata's
I'm rich, bitch, I can't help but brag
More G's then a Gucci bag

Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em
Get 'em, Jeezy, I got 'em

Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man
I listen to it, now it's in the trash can
Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man
I listen to it, now it's in the trash can
Ya album's garbage, I bought ya shit, man
I listen to it, now it's in the trash can
Think Jeezy a liar
Spit the straight drop, n* set the city on fire
Call the firemen
All you fake rap n* better retire man
Real recognize, real n*
Sell a lot of chickens, call me Popeye's
You tryin' too hard, I make it look easy
And, all that cheap ass jewellery's got you looking cheesy
Don't make me laugh
See this shit around my neck, it costs a brick and a halfEmbed
