Takeoff
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Bust a nigga brain if he try to take a chain (Gang)
22 chains and they all say my name
Gang gang gang give a fuck about a bitch (Fuck her)
75 karats in my new necklace (Nah for real)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (Ayy)
We don't give a damn about a bitch (Ayy)
Middle fingers up fuck a nigga and his clique (Fuck 'em)
I bet that pussy nigga won't come around me with his bitch (Niggas scared)
I take a nigga bitch (Gang, gang)
Watch on my wrist out of date but it glist
Jimmy Pang on my gang is off the chain for real
High school I spent most my days off the pill
Real talk I probably couldn't tell you how it feel
But I know how it feels to be rich cause I am (For real)

Still don't give a damn about a bitch (Fuck 'em)
Still don't give a fuck about a bitch (Fuck 'em, ayy, gang, gang)
Still don't give a damn about a bitch
Put your middle finger up fuck a nigga and his clique (Gang, gang, gang, gang)
Still won't give a dollar to a hoe
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't bro (Facts)
Fuck these pussy niggas they ain't gang
Niggas walking around with they fake diamond chainsYou might also likeEmbed
