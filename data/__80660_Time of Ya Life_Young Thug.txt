11 ContributorsTime of Ya Life Lyrics
No fuss, you dont have to fight
Find you a swag get high as a kite
Travel round the world catching private flights
We gon have a party only for one night
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life

Party hard, fuck what they say just party hard
Dowie Kartel with me he my body guard (blatt)
Them niggas around him them his bodyguards, (blatt, blatt)
No homo, we party though, we get narley though we smoke dro we fuck on hoes
And we rock shows, thats what im here for, I got Young Silk with me
He bought a louis vuitton quilt for me
And I dont smoke nun' but stank I got germs
Drink nun but syrup and I got worms
We in this bitch and we gon' party hard till they end this bitch, yeah

No fuss, you dont have to fight
Find you a swag get high as a kite
Travel round the world catching private flights
We gon have a party only for one night
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life

Find you a swag get high as a kite
Travel round the world catching private flights
We gon have a party only for one night
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life

Its my year, 20-12 I'm taking over
I woke up with some Luie kicks and fell asleep on a Gucci sofa (designer baby)
Thug you can count on me like 1-2-3 and I'mma bring some bad girls just to comfort you and me
I be bucking every club I ain't scared of you niggas
I am kicking so much shit, need a extra leg for you niggas
This gun dont play no games it need a trigger for the trigger
Im bool with SMM just keep the M inside the middle (millions)
I just came to party and she just came to come with me (lets go)
Im bout' to blow im like hold up who put the bomb on me (who did that to me)
BossCrew Quay with me, and he gon; shoot fasum
Thats ya girl ok cool cause she gon' choose fasum (thug)
No fuss, you dont have to fight
Find you a swag get high as a kite
Travel round the world catching private flights
We gon have a party only for one night
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life
Gon have the time of ya life, ya life gon have the time of ya life, ya life2Embed
