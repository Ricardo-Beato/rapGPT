Who you trying to get crazy with, ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?

To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like Spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair, got me going like General Electric
And the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Oh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big four-o
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain

Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack your ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming that ass
Leavin' your face in the grass
You know I don't take a do low lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain

Insane in the brain
In the brain (Kinda loco)
Insane in the brain
In the brain (Kinda loco)
Insane in the brain
In the brain— insane— (Kinda loco)
Insane in the brain
Yeah, here we go (Gunshot me head back)
Like Louie Armstrong played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon, I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes, I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make your eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain
Insane in the brain
Kinda loco
Insane in the brain
Kinda loco
Insane in the brain
