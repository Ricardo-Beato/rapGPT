Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som—
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?11Embed
