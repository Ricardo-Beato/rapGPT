Sonny Digital

I pack up every single thing in a suitcase
Your papa goin' trippin', he forgot to tie his shoelace
Don't worry baby, it won't be no case, I need a new face
I promise I'll be back by Wednesday, if not by then Tuesday

Don't believe a thing said on Twitter or the news
You know that the people that do anything for views
You know that your daddy is a good man
If your father had to gun 'em, then them niggas had it coming

I just wanna barbecue a blunt inside my habitat
I just wanna sit back reminiscing over Acid Rap
I just want a big suburban house and a little Cadillac
Laugh at how I turned into an aristocrat from alley cat
Allocatin' funds over alligator ponds
And my kids spitting image like a salivating tongue
Had to calibrate my mind, spend some time with my daughter
Got a lawyer that could turn a murder one to manslaughter
That's the truth
You might also like
I pack up every single thing in a suitcase
Your papa goin' trippin', he forgot to tie his shoelace
Don't worry baby, it won't be no case, I need a new face
I promise I'll be back by Wednesday, if not by then Tuesday

Don't believe a thing said on Twitter or the news
You know that the people that do anything for views
You know that your daddy is a good man
If your father had to gun 'em, then them niggas had it comingEmbed
