32 ContributorsATF Lyrics
Got me on the run
Uh, uh

"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF!"
Too late to send my girl downstairs to say, "He left"
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles
What you want me to do? Beep Carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, yo, get in, you drive
What the fuck you doing, nigga? Tryna stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by
Who the fuck coulda snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take them niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch! (Like you said nigga, almost)
Shit, the cops hit her and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
Drop it on the floor!
Boom! Got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is, "What about my kids?"
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
One, two, three, four, five more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm going out fast, and the last thing I hear is
"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF!"You might also like48Embed
