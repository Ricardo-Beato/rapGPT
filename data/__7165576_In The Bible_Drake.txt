Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off thе 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jеans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it
And you know (And you know, and you know)

Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

Okay, okay, okay
Trenches bitch, I got her a salon
Gucci and Pucci, it's deep in her budget
She hittin' up Virgil for Louis Vuitton
It's not in the Bible to wife off one girl
I'm Muslim, I go by Quran
The way I be smilin' and holdin' my gun
She think I be mimickin' Von, Grandson
She only play me in the whip
India Royale cosmetic, I'm just promotin' my bitch
Drake song do a billion streams for sure, I'm just promotin' her shit
Nasty with it
Take her to Sono Bello and get her some ass and titties
Fashion nigga
Rhude call when they drop like send my addy with it
Bitch left me and I'm glad she did it
Know I be testin' bitches
Back to back, I'm wrestlin' with 'em
Lean voice, I'm raspy with it
I did my dance one time on TikTok and went viral with it
Mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mm, mm-mm-mm (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

You've been on my mind
We've been spendin' time, but I'm scared
A good girl inside (A good girl inside)
But you're tainted every time that I'm there (Tainted)
Here we are now and it's crazy
Held my flaws down to you, baby
You love, you trust, you trust
I'm not what you think
Don't be proud of me
I'm not what you feel
And you gon' see it real soon
I'm not what you think
Don't be proud of me
I'm not what you feel
And when you see the real, will you still want me?20Embed
