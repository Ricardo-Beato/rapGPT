Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up and let’s get ill
(Hey yo, get your ass up and let’s get ill)
That’s right y’all, we more than rough, we callin’ your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes…

Don’t scandalize mine, I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?
Well it’s the squeeze of five fingers puffin' Smokey the Bear
Shinin’ black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare
While I’m rockin’ it, I rock in it
Like a little ball inside spray cans provide
Three coats for both child, woman and man
God bless the God, lay these streets wall to wall
We go “oooh!” (world famous)
You got popped like a flick by the rivalry clique and went “oooh”
It ain’t my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam
Thought you brought harm, you see
We iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cooks, y’all just rooks to me
Slidin’ up and down courts, I don’t like you can D
Why, try? Maseo be sky high
Since Luke was Luke Skywalk, my topic of talk
Is sheddin' shame all over your game, it’s life
Afrocentric love they must have passed drug
A life filled with (guns) that’s what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
Man, they muffle your voice man
So when I’m swimmin’ through the joint, I put the funk on hold
If you don’t, you see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with big lips for that ass to kiss
Most crews are post-current while we’re forever
Direct beats that’s contagious, love for all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity of hard hittas for real
I got peoples in the street that would blast your ass for this beat and go “oooh”
If you a big girl gettin’ your love between sheets, go “oooh”
Put your hands opposite to the ground if you lovin’ the sound
And go “ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh!” (how do I work this?)
