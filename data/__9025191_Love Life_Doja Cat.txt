Yeah, I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this, life's like this
Love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this, when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I said I love it when my life's like, yeah

I love it when my life's likе this
I love it when my ice look crisp
I lovе it when my clothes smell fresh
I love it when my fans speak French
I love it when they like my fits
I love it, how up-high my tits now
I love the way my man throw dick
I love his lips
I love it when my friends call back
I love showin' them brand-new tracks
I love roastin' 'em all and hearin' 'em all roast me back
Y'all never had no friends like that
I love it when my waist look small and ass look fat
I love it when my fans ain't mad, when I looked snatched
I love it when my mom cook food, she bake that mac
I love hearin' the roar when I go on the stage on tour
They love when I embrace my flaws
I love it when they doin' the same
I love it when my fans' love change, that's how we change the game

I love it when my life's like this, my life's like this

When life's like this, I'm thankful
Warm sun, good vibrations
When life's like this, be grateful
One life, one chance, take it

They love it when I write like this
I love it when my team feel strong and them deals flowin' in
I love that they don't fight like that
'Cause everybody know how to act because we tight like this
Not all of them be gettin' along
I hope that I can ease some the stress, can I chime in?
I know I've been the root of the cause
I know I've had a temper before, but still y'all don't quit
I understand you want me to win
I understand how hard that you bend
I understand the cause and effect now
Like dog-eat-dog and cat-eat-fish
I understand the jungle we in, now let me finish
We all gon' make mistakes and it's cool, I love how you grew
You offer me tools that make my life feel simple
I know it, that you lovin' me down
Man, I love y'all big and I love it when my life's like this
Yeah, I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this, my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this, life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this, my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I said I love it when my life's like this

Life's like this, I'm thankful
Warm sun, good vibrations
When life's like this, be grateful
One life, one chance, take it1Embed
