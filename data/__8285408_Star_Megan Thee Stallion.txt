19 ContributorsStar Lyrics
J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on, ooh
They don't need eyes to see when you're next to me
I'm a superstar (A star, a star)
And you should wanna take me out and make me smile
Lemme jump in yo' car (Yo' car, yo' car)

You gotta be a star to jump over the moon so when you touch on me
You're a shootin' star, oh yeah (A star, a star)
You know you got somethin' for the world to see and there I go
Still wonderin' who you are (A star, a star)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh)

I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Man, you must be crazy (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy
I'm a star, I'm a star

Ayy, how you get me is how you keep me (Yeah)
The pussy get stringy every time you get cheesy (Ah)
I used to get flowers (Yeah)
And get fucked in the shower
My pussy ate for hours (Yeah)
Now we gotta argue what's yours and what's ours
These other niggas lined up (Lined up)
Before your time's up (Time's up)
You better hope nobody help me make my mind up (Yeah)
Treat me like you wanna keep me, and like you only see me (Ayy)
And any bitch after Megan probably wanna be me (Woah, woah)
You might also like
Gotta be a star to jump over the moon, come fly with me
You're a superstar, oh yeah (A star, a star)
I know you got somethin' for the world to see and there she goes
They're all wonderin' who you are (A star, a star)
Oh (Ooh)

I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
You might go crazy (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Wanna be my baby? (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
You must be crazy
I'm a star, I'm a star, oh

Ayy, yeah, cash out, pass out, Big Benz, Bentley coupe
Shoppin' sprees, swipe cards, I ain't got no roof
Flights just to see art out in Rome
'Cause we got time, dinner in an arena, we're sprung
He pay attention, I pay that and more
Who you think I'm stackin' these racks for?

You gotta be a star to jump over the moon so when you touch on me
You're a shootin' star, oh yeah (A star, a star)
I know you got somethin' for the world to see and there I go
Still wonderin' who you are (A star, a star)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Tryna be my baby? (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy
I'm a star, I'm a star
OhEmbed
