8 ContributorsBrick Mason Lyrics
Hah, yeah
Hah (I ain't really finna tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit)

They call me Gucci Robert Kraft, I just picked Brady out the draft (Draft)
I'm tall, dark and handsome, plus my stash is on giraffe (God damn)
The black Mark Cuban, I'm in the shark tank with the Mavs
I go Danny Ainge for math, just might trade him to the Cavs (Wow)
Glacier coupe two-door (Two-door)
Pull up, make the doors do judo (Woo)
Big booty nympho (Hah)
No waist, hips on hippo (Mwa)
Amazon rhino
Crocodile Birkin albino
Bad bitch, I wanna sign her (Sign her)
I'm lookin' but still can't find her (Where at?)
I done got it in with the Haitians (Haitians)
I done went to war with Jamaicans
The money left body in basements (Huh)
I can cook brick like a mason
Dead fresh, jumpin' out the coffin (Coffin)
Big boss meetin' at the office (Boss)
Lil' nigga lost in the sauce (Huh)
Hood nigga, but I'm dressin' like a golfer (Floss)
Pull up to The Cheetah on a day shift (Hah)
Park at the front, it's a spaceship (Skrrt)
Cold shoulder, bitch, it's like a glacier (Burr)
Manicure, pedicure, facial (Wow)
Mob hit, Albert Anastasia (Pow)
I'ma put a hater in the paper (Pow)
I don't pay attention to a hater (Pow)
I just pay attention to the paper, Wop

I can cook brick like a mason
I just pay attention to the paper
I can cook brick like a mason
I can cook brick like a masonEmbed
