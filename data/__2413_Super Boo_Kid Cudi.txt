25 ContributorsSuper Boo Lyrics
Look at her she could be ma super boo
In a room crazy, sexy, cool
Intellectually sexy, her body is sick, her face is dope
Somethin like a eye candy photo
Hope to God the broad ain't a ho though
The way she walks is in slow-mo
Yep, ma mind got Tee-Vo
Every punk truck around
Plotting and scheming, wishing and dreaming
Jus for a little nano second to holla at her quick
Tryin' to holla for her name
Yellow bone with a tan like damn
Smile at me, so I smile right back
She move so effortless complimentin' her looks
I be commentin' up in her book

You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it

Mad views on her myspace shit
Just stoppin by, showing her love, while she sits
And all her friends are hot, but not like her she the number one spot
All I wanna do is really introduce Scott
Let her know my dreams and struggles to the top
Show her, that it feels good in a drop top
Rollin down sunset niggas can't stop
I can tell that she really got her mind right
Let me make that move when the time's right
Hope she don't mind a little limelight
You can't go wrong let's get right
And we gon let them other niggas stomp it out
Next step ye we gon' talk it out
I hop hotels 'til the next flight
I think about you cause your so right
You might also like
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it
(Lalalaalaaalaaa)

I know you probably like a lil stand offish
But just take my hand though
And save my world baby
Come ride with me

Let me get it, okay I got it she's so hot move so erotic
Take her to Cancun fly supersonic
Grown and sexy love Gin & Tonic
Askin questions like where you from?
I ain't gonna tell you you should just come
Take that journey beyond the clouds
Let's leave reality truth be told
Yeh baby girl this the code
Come be ma roadie backstage at shows
I can tell that them other niggas did you cold
But am a hot nigga with the heat for sure
I ain't fittin like a scarf in the summer
Am misemplyin and I need you in the summer
Layin on top me enjoying your company
Am runnin out of issue (Can't understand) when I kiss you
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it2Embed
