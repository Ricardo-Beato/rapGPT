Hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B

Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
I murder niggas on wax and forget where they buried
This the hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B
Or pistols on your album cover just like BDP

Single mothers on that EBT just tryna feed they seeds
Scammers and boosters livin' nice off of EDD
CCTV, all the cameras'll shoot ya
Soon as you let a shot off, it'll damage your future
It's some thugs in the hood that could have been hoopers
Some good girls who turned bad who could have been super-
-Models, some Dominicanos in Cabo
Some with the bloodlinе of Lagos, Lagos
So many stones in my hand just like Thanos
Eat Italiano, grazie, prеgo
Vibe to my music out in Prague, FaceTime, me and Haas
It feel good to feel alive, think I just had a breakthrough

I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me
I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me
I'm stolen property, kickin' the flavor to society
You might also like
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
I murder niggas on wax and forget where they buried
This the hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B
Or pistols on your album cover just like BDP

Man, this the hardest shit since DPG, Kurupt and Daz
Nate Dogg on the hook, Dr. Dre on the track
This melody be takin' me back but we pushin' it forward
187 on rappers, N-A-S, I'm a poet
At times, I get confused, they lie in they interviews
Get goose pimples whenever I'm puttin' on my jewels
Bailed so many brothers out, paid all they lawyer fees
After that, some turned they back, where is the loyalty?
Money's lovely but I could care less who has more than me
I'm just happy Mutulu Shakur got free
May he rest in peace, he was a warrior all of his days
And time move faster the more you get up there in age
In other news, I'm a G to the grave
I know they wanna see me burned out, depleted and drained
High blood pressure, instead I'm on a red page
My pupils are dilated, I throw on some dark shades

Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
I murder niggas on wax and forget where they buried
This the hardest shit since Rakim and Eric B
Or pistols on your album cover just like BDP
I'm MC Shan with an Uzi
Pistols on your album cover just like BDP
To the hardest artists out there, hard
Pistols on your album cover (Blaow)
Boogie Down Productions
I remember I put Tupac onto that Henny
Howard University, Howard Homecoming, D.C.
He's like, "What's this?"
(I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me)
He drank that shit though, word
Crazy, super hard, fact, facts, super facts
(I know the light is bright—)
Yeah, uh, pistols on my album cover, nigga, blaow
(I know the light is bright but keep on watchin' me)
Let's go, yeah (I—, I know the light—)
Peace to Mutulu, I'ma get at these dudes though (Light—)

History revisionists, they put themselves where they didn't dwell
I was there, saw them almost shit themselves
Walked in the club one day, the pistol fell
I gripped my belt, shit was real
Back then when I used to ship a mil' out the gate
Different world, digital scales to record sales
A symposium with my bros and 'em
That mean we kick it with official bros
My journey was great but difficult, what is life if it isn't both?1Embed
