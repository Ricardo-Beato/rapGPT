16 ContributorsHova Interlude Lyrics
Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to the Hamptons
20 million a wop, ransackin' mansions
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck
Niggas tryin' to lean on Jay, shots gon' stand you up
Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understandin' much
I hustle for the duckets
Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
I just love it
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love y'all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and that's right we comin' for the title...
Do you believe? It's Hova the GodYou might also like1Embed
