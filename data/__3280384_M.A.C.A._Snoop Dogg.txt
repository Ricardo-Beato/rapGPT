22 ContributorsM.A.C.A. Lyrics
'Cause I'ma keep it G real. I don't fuck with you, cuz
You disrespected me. You disrespect my hood by telling me
Take off my flag, asking how gangster I was, nigga
You lucky on that day I was acting cool, cuz
I told you I ain't got time for that, but nigga, today I got time, cuz
("You know what? We likes to party...We likes to party
We likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody...")

Ay young world, the world is yours
Ay young world, the world is yours
Young world, young world
The world is yours
Young world, the world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours

The president say he wants to Make America Great Again
Fuck that shit, we gon' Make America Crip Again, cuz

As I look around I see so many millionaires
With skin like mine, don't pretend like I'm
With that bullshit, your president been tweeting
Them black boys is balling out, the whole block been eating
You punk pigs we calling out
I'ma line y'all on up
Then start my own league, I'ma sign y'all on up
I'm thinking who my heroes be, thank God for the Negro League
Colin Kaepernick was blackballed, ah, nigga, please
This still America with three K's, believe that shit
The world is yours my nigga, so go and see that bitch
Every chance you get hit that lick and get that shit
Put your name down and your thang down
We gon' Make America Crip Again

Ay young world, the world is yours
Ay young world, the world is yours
Young world, young world
The world is yours
Young world, the world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours

Don't ya look strange?
Having all that power but you won't make change
But don't trip we Crip and we gang up too
And if I do a count, I'm sure we got more guns than you
Now just imagine if we stop shooting our own kind
I'm a Crip with no color lines, that mean I'm colorblind
I learned that, turnt that, Willie Lynch, burnt that
G status earned that
Now that I'm your OG, it's my job to teach you
Show you, look out, reach you
Every chance you get hit that lick and get that shit
And put your name down and your thang down
We gon' Make America Crip Again

Ay young world, the world is yours
Ay young world, the world is yours
Young world, young world
The world is yours
Young world, the world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours
("You know what? We like to party
We like to party...We like to party
You know what? Yo, peep this, we like to party")1Embed
