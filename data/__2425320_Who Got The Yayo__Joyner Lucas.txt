Yeah, yeah
Who got the yayo? (Who got the yayo?)
Who got the...
Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo? (Who got the yayo?)
Who got the...
Who got the yayo?
Who got the... Who got the...

Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I need some cut when I'm using the scale
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fail
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I know some hustlers I'm cool with in jail
I'll be god damn if I work a real job
I need thousands of dollars the movement is real
So who got the yayo?

Who got the plug?
Promised my auntie I'd never sell drugs
She told me pray if I ever need guidance
The truth was my logic, I never got love
Workin' my ass off to see where it get me
I need some white girl, I need me some Becky
Packets of money, I bet that they'll love me
Cause none of my honeys don't even respect me
Who got the yayo? Show me them niggas
Bitch, I've been rapping since HOV was a dealer
There's too many rappers that no one can hear 'em
And Diddy and Yeezy don't notice a nigga
Don't notice a nigga, tell me who next
Who got that Yayo? Who got that best?
Grandma gon' kill me she find that I'm dealin'
But my time is limited who got the stretch?
250, 350, 550, yeah
I got some heat when they ride with me, yeah
I wanna see what they got for me
Nigga now who got the yayo? don't lie to me, yeah
Don't get it twisted I move and I ain't lost a step
I don't usually get played off the left
I got Hitlers like Adolf that hate on a nigga
Then take off and then its a pill at the 
And I'm cooking like Raekwon the Chef
Poppa told me don't leave cake on the dresser
They playin' not death
Pray on a downfall I hope I fall down
Then they all keep just smilin' then there go my rep
What she gon' say, I need this rap money move out the way
If I don't get famous then who got the yay?
Who got the yay? Who got the yay?

Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I need some cut when I'm using the scale
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fail
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I know some hustlers I'm cool with in jail
I'll be god damn if I work a real job
I need thousands of dollars the movement is real
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?

Who got the, who got the
Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
Who got the yayo? (x2)
Ship me some packages who got the mail
I'll be god damned if my music'll fail
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?

Who got the yayo? Who got that coco
I don't know shit about chopping no cholo
Heard you know niggas that cop for the low-low
Be careful them snitches call cops on the low-low
And I just be solo, I just be dolo
Pushing a hooptie, I'm riding a loso
Under the radar, can't look like no target
Them niggas was talking but not anymore doe
Who got the yayo? Who got the crocket?
That Betty Crocker they using then cop it
Burying these niggas, put two in a coffin
I'm usually exhausted the truth is I'm driving
2000-and fucking-5 miles with no choppers around
If I make it from rapping then I can sit down
But the truth is this shit is not promised for now
So I guess I'll just move in wich-y'all niggas
Now gimmie 250, 350, 550, yeah
I need some heat when they ride with me, yeah
I wanna see what they got for me nigga
Now who got the yayo? Don't lie to me, yeah
Don't get it twisted I move and I ain't lost a step
I can spit like I ain't lost a breath
Running this shit with the heat on and ain't broke a sweat
What the fuck is you think you gon' get
Put the cake on my back, bleeding my ink from this pen
In my heart I still think I'mma win
If I don't then I guess I'll just trap out the bando
Move keys a pianos and lay in the sand
What the fuck you gon' say
I need the trap money move out the way
If I don't get famous then who got the yay?
Who got the yay, nigga who got the yay?
Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I need some cut when I'm using the scale
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fail
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I know some hustlers I'm cool with in jail
And I'll be god damn if I work a real job
I need thousands of dollars the movement is real
Nigga who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?

Who got the , who got the
Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
Ship me some packages who got the mail
So who got the yayo?
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fail
So who got the yayo?
Who got the, who got the, who got the yayo?
Who got the yayo? (x2)
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fa-
Who got the yayo?
I never wanted to sell any drugs
Pass the cocaina, cocaine or coquito
That power, perico that product is Deebo
Might need a lot of them kilos
I might need a pound just for me doe
Cause I just be stressin'
I got some problems I'm guessin
I'm crazy you probably think different
I'm high on a mission
Tomorrow ain't promised
So this is just me whippin' pies in the kitchen
The pastor keep preachin' I think keep singing that gospel
Then I look straight through the bible
All of my teachers said rappin' is easy
But being successful is harder than I knew
And I would just nod I said, "Well I'm gonna try"
She looked back at me and stared, "Do what you can"
I said, "Well what if I fail?" She said, "Just do it again"
Do what you fail, don't let the devil inside you
Don't let the ghetto deprive you
Pray everyday, but if you lose all of your faith
Then you must do what you got to
Then you must do what you got to
My nigga got get it, go take it go make it you business
Cause haters don't listen, now who got the flavor
I'm missing, now who got the flavor said

Who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I need some cut when I'm using the scale
I don't sell drugs, it's not really my style
But I need a plan if this music'll fail
So who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
I know some hustlers I'm cool with in jail
And I'll be god damn if I work a real job
I need thousands of dollars the movement is real
Nigga who got the yayo? Who got the yayo?
Who got the, who got the, who got the yayo?
Who got the yayo?Embed
