25 ContributorsFYI (Know Now) Lyrics
I'ma fuck his moms just because
I been doin' shit that these niggas wish they could
I been hittin' licks, hittin' licks, hittin' juugs
Way back before, nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
You ain't know then, you know now

Uh, real roadrunner on a baby
10 chains, real gold, look like a 40 baby
Can't no nigga tell me shit 'cause I been on it lately
Can't no nigga tell me shit 'cause bitch, I'm poppin'
Saint Laurent jeans, these ain't no Robins
Who these fuck niggas think they clockin'?
Who these fuck niggas think they robbin'?
Not me, no, not me
Iced out my wrist, yeah, it's for a hobby
All these niggas hoes, get them from beside me
Bitch, I am a pro, ball like Dennis Rodman
Oh, oh, all my hoes say Lil Boat so cocky
I was born with the sauce, that shit in my IV
Obviously, oh
You might also like
I'ma fuck his moms just because (Lil Boat)
I been doin' shit that these niggas wish they could
I been hittin' licks, hittin' licks, hittin' juugs
Way back before, nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
You ain't know then, you know now

Ain't gay but I love Ben Franklins
I had stopped givin' a fuck 'bout what them fucks thinkin'
First year in the game and I'm in the rankings
What's your bank statement? What's your bank statement?
I'm so rich every time I clear with one payment
I'm so up, all the birds know what's up with me
Who would have thought Lil Boat was in Oregon how the ducks on me
How the ducks on me, how the ducks on me
I'ma always win 'cause Lil Boat keep the coach with him
My bitch a cowgirl, man, she always keep them colts with her
She keep that coke with her inside her coat, she got a Coke figure
Nautica Lil Boat, boy, I don't wear Hilfiger, no

I'ma fuck his moms just because
I been doin' shit that these niggas wish they could
I been hittin' licks, hittin' licks, hittin' juugs
Way back before, nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
Yeah, pussy nigga, I thought you knew
You ain't know then, you know now1Embed
