Yo, this the Queen Bee
And I came to say a little somethin'
On my girl Missy's shit
Now see I got somethin' to say
That's right, I got a problem
I got a problem wit all y'all muthafuckas out there
That got a problem wit us calling ourselves a bitch
Yeah that's right, I said it muthafucka, bitch! What?
You see, bitch is a strong word
And only strong bitches can use that motherfuckin' terminology
Bitch, ha
I mean... if u can't wear the name, don't try to use it
Shucks

Sway or do-si-do like you loco

Yeah, what's the deal, y'all? This Missy Elliott
Givin' y'all magazine writers, radio cats, listeners or plain ol' haters
A small piece of, of my album which is titled Under Construction
Under Construction simply states that I'm a work in progress
I'm workin' on myself, you know
Uh, ever since Aaliyah passed, I view life in a more valuable way
Lookin' at hate and anger, and gossip, or just plain old bullshit became ignorant to me
When you realize in a blink of an eye, you walkin' down a church isle
And that was meant for weddings and happiness but realizing those same church isles are used to
To view a loved one for the last time
From the World Trade families to the Left Eye family
Big Pun family, you know, Biggie family, 'Pac family
To the hip-hop family, we all under construction, tryna rebuild, you know, ourselves
Hip-hop done gained respect from, you know, not even respect from, but just, like, rock and roll
And it took us a lot of hard work to get here
So all that hate and the animosity between folks, you need to kill it with a skillet
You don't see Bill Gates and Donald Trump arguin' with each other
'Cause both of 'em got paper and they got better shit to do
Get more paper
So all I'm sayin' is, let's take hip-hop back to the rope, follow me

Then pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg (Oh!)
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking **** bitch in her **** with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, or back out
Lookin' for somebody 'of' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers (Eat this)
I flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

Won't you busa rhyme for me, boy?

I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology (Whoops)
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (Shut up!)
I made this rap game suspenseful
Cause now I got an impulse game to insult you wit a pencil (Bitch)
They waste the paper on you, chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'

Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' TECs at you until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you (Ah!)
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth (Grrr)
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground
(Keep filming!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
Chopped 'em in half, suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy! Get back

Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind

Cruise up and down one-two-fifth
Looking for a guy like you to get with

Seen the size of his feet, so I couldn't deny him
Might as well try him, the freak that I am

After having a drink I start to feel unusually horny
Swelling stone, or well writ poems

Big bankroll to help me retire

Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night

I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga

Go ask your brother if y'all don't believe
I control the industry 'cause Missy in the lead
Uhh, I'm talkin to you man
With my upper hand, the fans call me Dapper Dan (Whoo!)
When I was young, my pops, throw rocks
Always shit talk to my moms and call the cops
Couldn't wait 'til I was nice and grown
Sick of daddy mouth 'til six in the morn'
On and on and on 'til the record scratch
And if I made a few scraps, I would never come back (Yes!)
Take moms with me and a few Adat's
And make a song about that and tell pops he's a rat (Yes!)
Okay!
(Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hold up)

Y'all don't really know my life

You're the reason I don't trust no one (No one)
And I don't love no one, from the places I've come
The sad songs, I've sung, all the times I've been stung
Boy you, bring the worst out of me (Holla)
And I can't count these tears I've cried
The emptiness inside that left me so petrified
Tried to keep, love alive, but I became too tired
Cause you, bring the worst out of me
Hey, hey, hey-ay-ay

And, I wish I coulda changed the way things have gone
And start life through a lie maybe once again (YES!)
I don't know when or where but somethin' must have went wrong
And all I have to say, is now...

When I sing this song I get so teary eyed

I was gonna marry you, have kids for you
Stay true to you, live life with you (Holla)

We on top, above the charts, how easy we forget
Do you think without Him, you would be who you are?
For if He made heaven and earth, He also made you a star
So as we reach the year 2000, you know there's one higher than us
And I come to be that too, to tell you, in God we must trust

So I moves it slowly
Brush up and let him hold me
Let me spit some baloney
Baby you could call me

But you got to back up off me
Wearing cubic zirconia

I put the heat on young gun
Fresh meat he season
Yes, yes we used to creep down the beach
He was insane like Rick James
And with a mask he's Superfreak

Oh God, my eyes, they water like a preacher who sin
I'm only human, but
The world has put me on a platform
Since the day I was born to only wait for my downfall
But like a brick wall, I'm too hard to break
Okay, I do make mistakes, but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah, baby girl, I've learned to love those while they're still awake
Sleep, sleep and prepare a place for those who are good
In the projects and hood, gifted or misunderstood
I know Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still number one
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader, a teacher, a guider

See I don't wanna say that this is the end
I'll end by saying this is where we'll begin
Hip-hop is a freedom of expression
Not a freedom of depression
Can I make my one suggestion
Look at how we're labelled gangster rappers
Is that their only impression, wake up
Rap is a craft, art and a rap of sport
Something like a game of basketball can't be taught
But yet we accept the name thug, like that's fly
See how they covered our eyes
Give us names to separate us
Sit back and watch us beef and make us hate us
Say what, I'm done talking
Mary J. Blige, let 'em know this is not a test
I hear you calling

What you hear is not a test
I'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)
See me and my crew and my friends
We're gonna try to move your feet (move around, move around)
See I am Mary Blige (yes I am)
And I'd like to say hello (thank you for inviting me)
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown
The purple and yellow (everybody)

And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat she was hot as the nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her

But when he need a few dollars
He know where to run to

You know, first before I do that

"Why you gotta— Why you gotta sing all these nasty records?"
And all that, but I be representin' for the ladies and
We got somethin' to say
We've been quiet too long
Lady-like, very patient
We ain't get mad when Prince had his ass out
We thought he was gonna turn around to the front
And have the front out too
But, you know, that didn't happen
We always had to deal with— with the guys
You know, talkin' about how they gon' wear us out on records
And— And you know, so I had to do records that was strictly
Representin' for my ladies and— and how to keep your man
Keep his eyes from wandering, looking around
And sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug
I'm not sayin' go out and do it, but if you do
Strap it up before you smack it up, flip it, slow it down, oh no!

This is a Misdemeanor exclusive
(If your radio is experiencing any kind of difficulties)
(Turn the volume up)
Yes, t-turn the volume up
Yes, t-t-turn the volume up
This is an exclusive (Turn the volume up)

It's very necessary, on the contrary
No, you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?
For this, you better hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, 'cause my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that Bevy
My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry
The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like Tom and Jerry
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary
The words that I spit don't fit in that category
Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry
And yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry
'Cause when this album drops, you whack MC's will all get burried

So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me

I got cable, now check out how I made my paper
Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader
Black people wake up and see your ass later

If you don't got a gun (It's alright)
If ya makin' legal money (It's alright)
If you gotta keep ya clothes on (It's alright)
You ain't got a cellular phone (It's alright)
And ya wheels don't spin (It's alright)

MC's stop the beef, let's sell (It's alright)

I need rims that don't glisten and a booming system
First piece of change I see, I'm gon' get one
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it (Rewind)
(I can hear myself, but I can't feel myself)
(I wanna feel myself like Tweet)
745 no license to drive
I ain't even got a home, I guess I'll live in my ride
Fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt
Need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt
Evisu Jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like David Beckham
Anybody in my way, I wet them
I'ma be this way till the cops come catch 'em
Til' detectives sketch 'em
On the sidewalk wit' chalk, New York's infections
Til' I got taught a lesson
Couple niggas gone, couple went corrections
Emory Got 10
Ty got fifteen, nigga even my kin
Got five years bringin' nineteen in
But just think I used to think like them
Now they gotta live through the pictures that I send them in the pen
Hope you don't start ya life where I end

Long hair and the voice of a hummingbird
You'll be singing them same old songs

Let's not wait 'til we lose another important emcee in the rap game to start sayin' chill out with the dumb shit
And all of that, you know, um
We could all stand for goin' under a lil' construction
