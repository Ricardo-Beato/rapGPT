Wu Tang Clan
Wu Tang Clan and Iron Man
Lead us to the promised land
And we will build upon this land
Until we free all black man
Iron man
Lead us to the promised land
Teach us how to raise our fam
Through love and economic plan
Living out Allah God plan

Wu Tang Clan and Iron Man they were wise, they will lead us, they will lead to the promised land and we will fight, and we will build, we will build upon this land, and we will free the black man, and free the world over the family, and we will build, and we will teach of the word of Allah, and Allah is ONE, Allah is one, and we will teach and prove Allah is one and his word shall spread throughout the universe, and he shall strike down with a mighty force and dispose these devils to the pits of hellYou might also like1Embed
