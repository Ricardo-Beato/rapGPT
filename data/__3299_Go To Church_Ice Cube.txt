48 ContributorsGo To Church Lyrics
Nigga, you need to stop snitchin'
All that yip-yappin' and jaw-jackin'
Nigga, if you scared, go to church
You knew the job was dangerous when you took it
What up, it's the big boss Dogg, Snoop D-O-double-G, eastside L-B-C
And I'm bobbin' to the beat of my OG homeboy Ice Cube
And I'm c-walkin' on the motherfuckin' concrete

Yo, if you're fucked up, put your cups up
Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, nigga, what's up?
See, he's a gangster, I'm a hustler
Yo, it's either thank ya or it's fuck ya

I'm down with Lil Jon, ain't got to pretend (Yeah)
Crunk juice, nigga, run the club that you in (Hey)
You scary motherfuckers don't wanna bring the ruckus (Nah)
You just spend all your time in the club tryna duck us (What?)
And if you walk by, nigga, I'ma knock fire, nigga
From your ass, you can come try, nigga (Hey)
In the hood, all the way down south (Yeah)
I ain't Mike Jones, keep my name out'cha mouth, bitch (Mike Jones)
We can get it crackin' if it get to clickin' clackin'
Look at Mister Jackson, nigga, with no reaction
If you scared, go to church, we gon' hit you where it hurts
That don't work, we'll put you in the dirt (Hey)
'Cause a whole lot of rappers make a whole lotta noise (Hey)
Lyrics full of steroids, niggas paranoid (Hey)
And when you get that blowup, it make you throw up
When you realize your favorite rapper ain't got no nuts
You might also like
If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)
If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)

Click-clackin', pistol packin', Crip raggin' folio
Who the only nigga in the club with the toolio?
You ain't know? Yeah, you did; there it was, there it is
"Is that Coolio?", nah, bitch, let me in
Jibber-jabber, snatch ya, get at ya
Spit at actors and rappers
Hang out with kidnappers and jackers
Make money off crackers; can you imagine how I keep shit crackin'?
It's the big boss Dogg, I'm back in action and smashin'
I flash with the bling, I surpass the supreme
You don't really wanna have a clash with my team
I mix hash with the green, I'm the last of the kings
If I got a bitch with me, she got ass in them jeans
Rollin' through your neighborhood, my Cadillac so clean
Servin' all you suckas, 'cause you all dope fiends
Just like that dope man, nigga, what's up?
You run up with that bullshit, I'll fuck yo' ass up
If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)
If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)

You scared, you scared
You scared, motherfucker, you scared
You scared (You scared), you scared (You scared)
You scared, motherfucker, you scared (You scared)
You scared, you scared
You scared, motherfucker, you scared
You scared (You scared), you scared (You scared)
You scared, motherfucker, you scared (You scared)

If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)
If you a scared motherfucker, go to church (Go to church)
If you a gutter motherfucker, do your dirt (A do your dirt)
If you a down motherfucker, put in work (A put in work)
If you a crazy motherfucker, go berzerk (A go berzerk)
It goes one for the money (Hey), two for the show (Yeah)
Three for the pussy, four for the glow (Hey)
Five for the rookies, six for the pros (Nah)
Seven for the numbers of them fuckin' zeroes (What?)
Eight for the haters, nine for the cause
Ten for my niggas behind big bars (Hey)
Fuck these devils and they laws (Yeah)
Never question the size of Ice Cube's balls15Embed
