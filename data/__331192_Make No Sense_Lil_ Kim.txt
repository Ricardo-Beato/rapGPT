8 ContributorsMake No Sense Lyrics
Yow Little Kim you dun kno you're the original Queen Bee
Ah wha we say is a gangsta thing
Tanya Stephens from Jamaica
Wha you waan we do
A wha you mean
Ah murda we haffi murda some pour soul
Yuh dun kno (Yeah)
Blood clat all dat (Check, check, check, mm)

My poppa taught me how to ride dicks
Cut em off, freeze 'em, then use 'em as ice picks (Yeah, yeah)
Hard times baby
Got bitches upstate doing 2 to 8
For first degree rape
What I can't get I take
My name hold weight (Wha you seh)
Like I said my name hold weight (Dun kno)
Pussy is the bait (Dun kno)
Around the way they call me the Pink Panther
Ask Leon Ganther, haha (How bout)
He know, the rap Josephine Baker
Keep her wrist looking like strobe lights
When I bust my gun, niggas think I'm babylon (Fer real)
Cause my rocks shine on just like they sirens (Boc boc boc boc..dun kno)
Decepticons, deceptive nets
Fuck it
Who you with
Betta claim your set
Caution walkin' on me might break your neck
I'm like water on the floor slippery when wet (For real)
Niggas wanna test me, I doubt that
Automatic uzis, we about that (You dun kno!)
We gun you in the sun or the rain
Point blank range
Me and my bitch just squeezed about 6 (Yea, yea)
You might also like
And last night I heard the screamin'
But it don't make no sense fi call the police (Wah me seh)
And last night I head the shooting
But it don't make no sense fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight

I got Lil' Kim dats
And fuck nigga hats
Where my bitches is at?
Where my bitches is at? (Right here)
Be sure to tell them cats to lick between ya laps
And when it's they turn, take a lil' nap
Them dogs start barkin' throw they ass a snack
Pat 'em on they back and that's that
It may sound rude
But I don't love you dudes
Tape you eatin' my pussy and throw you on the interlude (scene)
You think I give a fuck cause you paid for my food?
Put you out on the highway and make you strip nude (Hehe)
Then drive away in your car with your wallet
Thought I was sweet meat
Look what you done started (Run dat)
You ain't know about the set it off Queen Bitch
In the Porsche, license plate read "Filthy Rich"
I spend money (For real)
Lend money
I played niggas with money
Matter fact I love money (Run dat)
And I never borrow
Even if the ones low (It's all about)
Cause if it cost ten, I give 'em 20 so I never owe (Scene)
And other women can't stand the way I'm livin'
They not my problem
My main concern is Kim (Is all about)
And last night I heard the screamin'
But it don't make no sense fi call the police (Wah me seh, wha me seh)
And last night I head the shooting
But it don't make no sense fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight (murda! murda!)

As we pop the bub' up in the reggae club
DJ rock rub-a-dub jams by Beenie Man (Scene)
Me, Cease, P. Diddy and the fam
In the back by the rest rooms, shaking hands with the fans
Funny style cats bump us while we dance
You know a broke nigga always fucks up the plans (For real)
DJ switch the music to the Wu-Tang Clan
D-Rock hit him in the face with the St. Ides can (Chop)
Security came through, broke it up, then he ran
Be back at the bar again laughin' and partyin'
Jerks showin off pullin 50s out they clothes (For real)
Please babe-bro we blow our nose with those (You know)
Linen crushed out, Egyptian mushed out
Sound boy lickin' shots then the party rushed out
My niggas, they surround me like the Pope
You should've seen the shit, one big joke
And as usual, this cat with an afro
Snitchin' for no dough info to popo
Fuckin' dodo
Silly like a Tamagotchi watch
I hate cowards
Ya'll suckas need to blow cock (For real scene)
And last night I heard the screamin'
But it don't make no sense fi call the police (Wah me seh)
And last night I head the shooting
But it don't make no sense fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight

Yeah, Lil' Kim, Tanya Stephens
The Queen of Reggae Soul
And the Queen of Hip Hop
The Queen of Rap baby
Bop bop bop bop

Me know a fat boi, he is a mampy
Dat a mampy, no stop to carry me
Carry me to a movie and to a party
The boi test me, the mampy defend me
Drap up a big boi, beat him up badly
Come feel me mampy Lord no fraid of nobody-dy-dy
I said an oversize oversize oversize mampy
Oversize oversize my ba-ba-ba-baby
Oversize oversize oversize mampy
Oversize oversize my baby
Haha, yeah
You ain't know I knew that shit, yeah
My whole family, they sound rude

And last night I heard the screamin'
But it don't make no sense fi call the police (Wah me seh)
And last night I head the shooting
But it don't make no sense fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight1Embed
