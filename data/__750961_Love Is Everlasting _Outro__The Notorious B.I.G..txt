7 ContributorsLove Is Everlasting (Outro) Lyrics
Let's say there are many times I looked,
and saw reflections of my son.
I argued sometimes, consulted;
I saw results, and said "Well done."
I thought of him constantly,
and silently asked "Why?"
I tried fervently,
and just cannot say goodbye.
I lived with visions twined and twisted,
passion so cold,
and withered thoughts, battered and shattered.
I dreamed dreams.
Cherished memories.
Housed friendship,
and promises that mattered.
In the end,
time is treasured;
But love for my son?
It's everlasting.Embed
