Jump back the track, gonna wreck it now
Watchin' y'all get it, to the record now
Catchin' y'all attention, so shake it now
Oh no, findin' my flow, gonna break it down
Came a long way, can you take it now?
Regulatin' the regular, do your thing now
On the floor, here we go, can you kick it now?
Black Superman back in the building now

Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman

Do your thing, the damn thing baby, bring it now
Go back like 8 tracks and Cadillacs
Way before crack and Similac
Hell with the taps and new booby traps
Hear the hand claps, where the party at?
Do the damn thing and get'cha gravy on
Cause you be gettin' it down and your crazy on
Go on and on to the break of dawn
You be givin' a damn cause ya baby gone
Do what'cha wanna do, but do the right thing
If its the right thing, then go on do the damn thing
I know you got soul (Cause I know you got soul) like a chicken wing
Treat me like a king, let me hear you sing
You might also like
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building
(Back, caught you lookin' for the same thing)

"Black is back"
"Once again back is the incredible"
"There can be no black-white unity until there's first some black unity. We cannot think of being acceptable to others until we have first proven acceptable to ourselves."

Money can't buy you love, thought you knew that
Eight days a week like a rugrat
But you a sex machine and can't face facts
Gotta chase the cat, hear the hand claps
Turn the damn thing up, here we go again
No meaning no, so then you know again
Flow it like a poet and get ready then
Dance gotcha tremblin' in Timberland's
Jump back, pop the track Gonna shake it now
Check the cat, gettin' wrecked, gonna break it down
To the record now, gotta break it down
Rhyme the flow on the go, c'mon get it now
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman
Back, back, now
Back in the building, Superman

"Damn, back again, on track again"

Yeah, I'm saying we went from Gods to niggas, from queens to bitches;
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven?
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven?
Platinum gold, a house and a car but poverty all around you by far, people living under bridges or in a car;
Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living, but the Man from the east calls it a wilderness;
Cause Heaven for Whites is Hell for Blacks in america
Heaven and Hell are two conditions of Life
Not a place up there or a place down there
It's a condition of life on earth, so value life
Heaven is not things, it's a higher level of thinking
And at the moment, one may change the conditions of life
Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and Moet, Kristal and how much sex you can have is heaven
Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time, but being able to meet life's struggles head on, head on, head on, without compromising your Soul soul soul soul
In this worlds Life, not Life after death; life on earth
Life, not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
Sit yourself in heaven at once
A woman is a very important part of heaven
She produces heaven with you
And if she is connected to the source of Life
So heaven is a condition of Life
And you can have it on earth
SO VALUE LIFE
VALUE LIFE
Who in the hell told yall you were in heaven
Oh, Oh
Lord Have Mercy!Embed
