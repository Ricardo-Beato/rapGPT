46 ContributorsKnocked Off Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Ayy

I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion (Woo)
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian (Beast)
Told my baby next February we're married (On blood)
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious (Hah)
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
You understand?
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (Pew pew pew pew)
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
You dig?
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (On blood)
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
B's up
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (Skrrrrrt)
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
Yeah, Stunna
They ain't gon' play with me, no no (Gah gah gah gah)
Yeah

Yeah, we roll these bitches like they centipedes (Damn)
We get this money, flip some hundreds then we blow some Gs (They on my what?)
I gave her life and then I showed her Bs (Roll it, roll it, roll it)
We fucked the world but now we overseas (Woop, woop)
Inside of the car, we stashed a hundred bricks (Swoo)
We put it down and hit the town, we 'bout the money trips (Woo)
Wait, the ice is rollin' 'cause we're rollin', bitch (Gah)
Flakes, the dope is colder 'cause we're polar, bitch (Whip, whip)
I answer the call and put her right beside me (Skrrrt)
Two, we 'bout that woop like them brand new Spyders (Skrrrt)
Keep your mouth closed, boy, 'cause we're aim and fire (Woah, woah)
I just might one night her, show love and wife her (Damn)
I'm bangin' green like the lizard in Geico (Woo)
I pull up and wet you, burn your top like Michael (Woo)
I got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles (Gah, gah)
It's big Bs with a hundred Gs in each one of my pockets

I'm not gon' pass, I'ma smash 'em
She want that nut so I blast her
My Bentley grey like a pastor
Whippin' that snow, no Alaska
Good head, she got her masters
Shawty a long way from dumb
Your money flat like a plasma
Good kush, smoke is the bomb
I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red
I don't fall in love, I run over it instead
Hey, babe, bobble that big ol' head
I'm like, "lil' baby, I don't know your kid"
I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead
They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy
Baby take a picture,  get that photo cred
She make me lean back like a sofa bed
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion (Woo)
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian (Beast)
Told my baby next February we're married (On blood)
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious (Hah)
